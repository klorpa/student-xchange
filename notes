====================
Immediate fixes before next release

- Add coords for Part 11 when finished with it
- Add month/year to side bar, pregnancy state?
- Bug on Part10Start Andrew or Professor and $0 nothing happens.  (See :mrgreen: below from tfgames)
- Bug on Part7Start5 broken endif (See :centerflag982: below from tfgames)
- Bug on Part95Start1  still incorrectly refers to Andrew if Peter's the one coming with you. (See :centerflag982: below from tfgames)
-----
:mrgreen:
In "Part10Start" if $RoommateAndrew or $DatingProfessor and $PlayerMoney > 0 then nothing happens. Those two if.../if blocks need:
CODE: SELECT ALL
	<<else>>
	  It makes you feel like a real adult, [[paying your bills off|Part10Responsible]] ahead of time.
inside the $PlayerMoney check (which should probably be "<<if $PlayerMoney <= 0>>" instead of "<<if $PlayerMoney lt 0>>", and earlier "<<if $PlayerMoney gte 0 >>" should probably be "<<if $PlayerMoney gt 0 >>", since you can't pay off the credit card if you have $0).

:centerflag982:
Another bug for ya: Part7Start5 has a broken endif toward the end:
CODE: SELECT ALL

<<if $DatingProfessor and !$PlayerProtectionTry and !$PlayerProtectionNone and !$PlayerProtectionWithdraw>>
			<<set $PlayerPregnantCheck = 0>>
		<</if>>
	<</if>
		
	<<set $PlayerRollDice = either(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)>>
	
It doesn't visibly break anything, but it does cause the dice-roll line not to execute, meaning $PlayerPregnantCheck later winds up being compared to the last dice roll from (as far as I can tell) the side-effect passage.

Also, Part95Start1 still incorrectly refers to Andrew if Peter's the one coming with you.

Cleanup Fixes

All
- Add title/headings, switch to H1
- Adjust formatting and image size
- See about adjusting video size down and or changing format to reduce space
- Check for videos bigger than 854width on disk:
  Part3
  Part5
  Part6
  Part8
  Part8_5
  Part9
  Part9_5
- Look for instances of more than one of gif/webm/mp4
- Look for unusued images and videos (or also any bad links)

====================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts

Look at Stats
- SexDifferentMaleCount doesn't update during 'Textbook' pledge week path, for example
- Adjust stats calculation for part 10
- Also should adjust implied sex between pages

Kidnapped path
- Change inventory and birth control and job

Pregnancy when Peter is the father
  - from :centerflag982:  On a somewhat related note, I really hope that there will eventually be a distinct pregnancy-reaction scene for when
    Peter's the father, rather than the generic "You know youâ€™ll be on your own..." scene. I mean, the

Earlier Parts:
- Veronica Cheerleader path: Ended up with a dead end after the Veronica cheerleader part where no options from the first classroom pic
  Looks like it was something with setting a variable inside of a Link tag.  Try to eliminate doing that
- (Deciding whether Peter helps you study) : If Hannah is mentor, and you go to the guys room and bring Peter back,
  later it says 'not that close' when seeing if he helps you study, but you've hooked up with him.  Probably similar if you are in
  chastity and blew him, possibliy also if you hook up and Sam is your mentor.
  Maybe less points than if keyholder, but more than just friends

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbor selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbor)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
