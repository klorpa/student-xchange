Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- see if gold-star function is doing what is expected
- Fix roommate when moving in to Sorority house (is this needed?)

- Other Roommate specific paths
  - Emily: Sharing Room with guy, ?
  - Hannah: ?
  - Samantha: Lesbian-only path  - Make sure can go through (depending on job, side effects, etc) with only lesbian sex
  - Olivia: Master

Suggestions from tfgames:
- Buridan
  - should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
  - would love more Barry content. A lot of the other neighbours seem to have more content associated with them

Cleanup Fixes
- possiblity tweak video sizes
- Look for instances of more than one of gif/webm/mp4
- Look for unusued images and videos (or also any bad links)

Back-end
- Revamping inventory
- Revamping body / side effect system

Earlier Parts:
- Consider making Job an array and/or eliminating side-jobs
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbour selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbour)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- Add month/year to side bar, pregnancy state
