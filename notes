====================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts

Earlier Parts:
- Veronica Cheerleader path: Ended up with a dead end after the Veronica cheerleader part where no options from the first classroom pic
  Looks like it was something with setting a variable inside of a Link tag.  Try to eliminate doing that
- (Deciding whether Peter helps you study) : If Hannah is mentor, and you go to the guys room and bring Peter back,
  later it says 'not that close' when seeing if he helps you study, but you've hooked up with him.  Probably similar if you are in
  chastity and blew him, possibliy also if you hook up and Sam is your mentor.
  Maybe less points than if keyholder, but more than just friends

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbor selection to debug mode?

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
