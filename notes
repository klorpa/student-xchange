================================================================================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- see if gold-star function is doing what is expected
- Fix roommate when moving in to Sorority house (is this needed?)

- Other Roommate specific paths
  - Emily: Sharing Room with guy, ?
  - Hannah: ?
  - Samantha: Lesbian-only path  - Make sure can go through (depending on job, side effects, etc) with only lesbian sex
  - Olivia: Master

Suggestions from tfgames:
- Buridan
  - should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
  - would love more Barry content. A lot of the other neighbours seem to have more content associated with them

Cleanup Fixes
- possiblity tweak video sizes
- Look for instances of more than one of gif/webm/mp4
- Look for unusued images and videos (or also any bad links)

Back-end
- Revamping inventory
- Revamping body / side effect system

Earlier Parts:
- Consider making Job and array and/or eliminating side-jobs
- Veronica Cheerleader path: Ended up with a dead end after the Veronica cheerleader part where no options from the first classroom pic
  Looks like it was something with setting a variable inside of a Link tag.  Try to eliminate doing that
- (Deciding whether Peter helps you study) : If Hannah is mentor, and you go to the guys room and bring Peter back,
  later it says 'not that close' when seeing if he helps you study, but you've hooked up with him.  Probably similar if you are in
  chastity and blew him, possibliy also if you hook up and Sam is your mentor.
  Maybe less points than if keyholder, but more than just friends
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbour selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbour)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- Add month/year to side bar, pregnancy state
