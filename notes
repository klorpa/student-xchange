Earlier Parts:
- Coach Persuation: Need to mention something about him having a copy of your key if you are in chastity
- Bedroom (Starting period) : don't mention tampons if in chastity
- Veronica Cheerleader path: Ended up with a dead end after the Veronica cheerleader part where no options from the first classroom pic
  Looks like it was something with setting a variable inside of a Link tag.  Try to eliminate doing that
- (Deciding whether Peter helps you study) : If Hannah is mentor, and you go to the guys room and bring Peter back,
  later it says 'not that close' when seeing if he helps you study, but you've hooked up with him.  Probably similar if you are in
  chastity and blew him, possibliy also if you hook up and Sam is your mentor.
  Maybe less points than if keyholder, but more than just friends

Side-effects
- Change so you can only revert 1 side effect, but that one doesn't come back.  Permanent isn't reversable.

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
