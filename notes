================================================================================
- Improving or eliminating academic and fun points
- Eliminating saying which roommate you liked and not (maybe let them pick later if it's something they'd be able to decide, or random if it's not (like walking in on them while showering))
- Engineering if trying to get pregnant: I don't know, it seems like that wouldn't be something they would care about. If anything, them having a willing pregnant test subject would broaden their research wouldn't it? I was trying to get that event specifically with the 'wanting to get pregnant' option to see i their was a 'haha you fools, I actually wanted to get pregnant, this isn't a punishment for me, haha' inner-monologue or something. I mean I get that for the event it's supposed to be a punishment, I just don't see why they would care about something like that when hiring you, not testing you yet.

Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts

-comment from forum "also its abit sad that your mistress doesnt react to your pregnancy, even when your locked up in chastity you take your mentor to the doctor"

- Go through and idenify inventory items ?
- Using <<remember>> for achievements?
  - https://www.refinery29.com/lesbian-slang-terms-definitions#slide-3
- see if gold-star function is doing what is expected
- Fix roommate when moving in to Sorority house (is this needed?)

- Other Roommate specific paths
  - Emily: Sharing Room with guy, ?
  - Hannah: ?
  - Samantha: Lesbian-only path  - Make sure can go through (depending on job, side effects, etc) with only lesbian sex
  - Olivia: Master

Suggestions from tfgames:
- Buridan
  - should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
  - would love more Barry content. A lot of the other neighbours seem to have more content associated with them
    - *** I added some Barry content in Part 13
    
Cleanup Fixes
- possiblity tweak video sizes
- Look for instances of more than one of gif/webm/mp4
- Look for unusued images and videos (or also any bad links)

Back-end
- Revamping inventory
- Revamping body / side effect system

Earlier Parts:
- Consider making Job an array and/or eliminating side-jobs
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbour selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbour)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- Add month/year to side bar, pregnancy state
