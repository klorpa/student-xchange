=========

- Added option to skip over Christmas (year 1)
- Added option to go to uncles if on ministry path (year 1)
- Added option to max out all side effects
- Added option to not blow mechanic when no money, if you've only had sex with one person (in addition to the other reasons it would allow it)
- Added a continuation for art path if you decide to go back to art modeling and not go with Ken
- Added option to not cuckold Peter

Couldn't duplicate, may have already fixed: 1.14.03 seems to have broken the child names on the Paul path. Once I get to PaulWife8 there's two errors:
Error: <<set>>: bad evaluation: Unexpected identifier
Error: <<set>>: bad evaluation: Cannot read property '1' of undefined
fixed: And one other minor error. In AndrewWedding there's one place where it says Paul instead of Andrew.
fixed: That page also has a couple of really minor word errors:
fixed: - dishevled should be dishevelled
fixed: - "Your legs a quickly tire from dancing with Andrew" shouldn't have the word "a".
fixed: - That particular sentence might read a bit better (and this is my subjective perspective so you might disagree, in which case ignore this) if you added some conjunctions. I'd change it to "and then your father" and " so you let Faith"

================================================================================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- Improving or eliminating academic and fun points ?

Suggestions from tfgames:
- should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
    
Back-end
- Revamping body / side effect system

Earlier Parts:
- Consider eliminating side-jobs from beginning (still have them at the student loan part)
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- consider adding additional side effect from second implant birth control option.  Triggered every time it prevents a pregnancy
