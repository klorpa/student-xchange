Changes/fixes before next release

TODO Says "Hannah is your mentor and roommate . Your neighbours are Zack and Barry" even though living with Aaron
TODO Part14 Add similar Bar choice (to what is currently in Kate Path) for when working at the Bar in other situations
TODO If using condoms, then do the engineering halloween event and get the fertility punishment, doesn't handle birth control correctly later on or in sidebar.  (Says none used, or multiple things)
TODO Part13/Boyfriend5.webm is not reachable (not a bug, just an impossible path).  see about using the image on a different path
TODO - If Mistress Kate put a chastity belt on the player character then there will be a reaction from Master Robert, but if Master Robert place a chastity belt on
TODO   the player character, then there are no reaction from Mistress Kate and the game continue like no chastity belt have been placed on the player. This could also be an opportunity to expand the story between the player character and between Mistress Kate and Master Robert.
TODO - "At the Big Game" in Part 13 if in Chastity doesn't seem to show anything with Chastity
TODO - Change Bartender job first screen.  I don't like the way the choices flip around
TODO - What if pregnant with Andrew and opt for adoption?  Currently ignores that.
TODO - Side effects from birth control shot on abroad path? (Trouble thinking? Horniness?)
TODO - I have noticed that on the Andrew relationship line, if the person get pregnant in the first round and decides to check the baby's gender and says a boy or a girl. But later in the story it is always a girl that the person gives birth to at the end of the story. If you Update the game maybe fix this some how.
TODO - make 100% option bith control cause a side effect (maybe libido, maybe random) whenever it prevents a pregnancy
TODO - sidebar doesn't mention Peter if you have his key and not dating him (Samantha as mentor, Peter as neighbor, side-job at stripclub)

——
[quote]Any plans for the mentors to join some of the sororities?[/quote]
I didn't have any plans about it, but I'm open to ideas if you had any.

I meant to imply also that there were a number of other sororities on campus as well.  Those just either weren't interested in you, or you weren't interested in them at all.  So it could also be that a mentor ends up in a rival sorority as well.  (Though I still don't have any plans/ideas along those lines.)
———
Someone requested a purple x-change user (or something similar).  Thought about including it, but hard to find content for tg+female (assuming they’d be a hookup or something for the main character)
================================================================================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- Improving or eliminating academic and fun points ?

Suggestions from tfgames:
- should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
    
Back-end
- Revamping inventory
- Revamping body / side effect system

Earlier Parts:
- Consider making Job an array and/or eliminating side-jobs
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbour selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbour)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
