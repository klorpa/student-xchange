-----
:centerflag982:
Also, Part95Start1 still incorrectly refers to Andrew if Peter's the one coming with you.
? - is this with Andrew/FWB ?
====================
Cleanup Fixes

All

====================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts


Suggestions from tfgames:
- Buridan
  - should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
  - would love more Barry content. A lot of the other neighbours seem to have more content associated with them

Pregnancy when Peter is the father
  - from :centerflag982:  On a somewhat related note, I really hope that there will eventually be a distinct pregnancy-reaction scene for when
    Peter's the father, rather than the generic "You know youâ€™ll be on your own..." scene. I mean, the

Earlier Parts:
- Veronica Cheerleader path: Ended up with a dead end after the Veronica cheerleader part where no options from the first classroom pic
  Looks like it was something with setting a variable inside of a Link tag.  Try to eliminate doing that
- (Deciding whether Peter helps you study) : If Hannah is mentor, and you go to the guys room and bring Peter back,
  later it says 'not that close' when seeing if he helps you study, but you've hooked up with him.  Probably similar if you are in
  chastity and blew him, possibliy also if you hook up and Sam is your mentor.
  Maybe less points than if keyholder, but more than just friends
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbour selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbour)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- Add month/year to side bar, pregnancy state

Later
- add a no-sex path
  - probably make it not possible with any (or at least certain) side effects
  - what job would this work with
  - probably have to mastrubate regularly or get too horny
