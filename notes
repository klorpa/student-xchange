Changes/fixes before next release

TODO Part13/Boyfriend5.webm is not reachable (not a bug, just an impossible path).  see about using the image on a different path
TODO Add naming the player - see if this can be included in the save file description

TODO - Suggestion: In the Experimental Birth Control, its quite difficult to get the "fail". Maybe the randomizer should be adjusted a little so it gets easier to hit? 
TODO - If Mistress Kate put a chastity belt on the player character then there will be a reaction from Master Robert, but if Master Robert place a chastity belt on
TODO   the player character, then there are no reaction from Mistress Kate and the game continue like no chastity belt have been placed on the player. This could also be an opportunity to expand the story between the player character and between Mistress Kate and Master Robert.

TODO - "At the Big Game" in Part 13 if in Chastity doesn't seem to show anything with Chastity

TODO - Change Bartender job first screen.  I don't like the way the choices flip around
TODO - What if pregnant with Andrew and opt for adoption?  Currently ignores that.

Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- Improving or eliminating academic and fun points ?

Suggestions from tfgames:
- should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
    
Back-end
- Revamping inventory
- Revamping body / side effect system
- Using <<remember>> for achievements?

Earlier Parts:
- Consider making Job an array and/or eliminating side-jobs
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbour selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbour)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
