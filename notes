Part10StartChastity
- Make Master scenario look at prefermen/preferwomen/preferboth to decide which to show

Part10End
- Change to say what you specifically are hoping for (night out with boyfriend, out of belt, etc.)

(Deciding whether Peter helps you study)
- If Hannah is mentor, and you go to the guys room and bring Peter back, later it says 'not that close' when seeing if he helps you study, but you've hooked up with him.  Maybe less points than if keyholder, but more than just friends

Part95Result2
- need an image

Sidebar - student life balance
- Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one

Sidebar - side effects
- Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level

Earlier Part: Coach Persuasion
- Need to mention something about him having a copy of your key if you are in chastity

Earlier Part: Bedroom (Starting period)
- don't mention tampons if in chastity

???
Ended up with a dead end after the Veronica cheerleader part where no options from the first classroom pic
Looks like it was something with setting a variable inside of a Link tag.  Try to eliminate doing that

Side-effects
- Change so you can only revert 1 side effect, but that one doesn't come back.  Permanent isn't reversable.
