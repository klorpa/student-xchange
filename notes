Immediate fixes before next release
  - None
====================
sex system - need to track
- partner (name, gender)
- type
- birth control method
- orgasm or not
- interactions with side effects
- add function call instead of directly pushing into array.  Should record when (once dates are in place) and also what birth control was in use (though can be overridden)

{sex: 'male', name: 'coach', vaginal: true, pregnancyExclude : true}



====
inventory system
==
body / side effect system

Other
- look for "they" and change to "he" or "she" where appropriate
====================
Fixes for Part 12
- see if can figure out how to get save files to be reusable (unless it causes a problem)
- Have a little not-pregnant check before spring break. Either mention period a couple weeks ago, or take a test and it's negative.  (unless they are pregnant from last semester)
- Check inventory page for new items (collar, ?)
- ? look at stats (sex counts etc) - add disclaimer on variables page if don't fix this this version
- Twine reports 1 broken link - figure out where

:centerflag982:
Also, Part95Start1 still incorrectly refers to Andrew if Peter's the one coming with you.
? - is this with Andrew/FWB ?

Fixed:
- Bug on Part7Start5 broken endif (from centerflag982@tfgames)
- Bug on Part95Start1 still incorrectly refers to Andrew if Peter's the one coming with you. (from centerflag982@tfgames)
- Bug on Part10Start if had >=$0 and with Andrew or Professor
- with andrew, got option to blow professor but declined, said I passed, but still says I'm on probation
- from ngedh: If you have Emily as a mentor, the page where you meet your neighbours doesn't handle the fact that one of them has been replaced by her boyfriend particularly gracefully. "One of them and the other seems to be a Thrill-Seeker."
====================
Cleanup Fixes

All
- Add title/headings, switch to H1
- Adjust formatting and image size
- See about adjusting video size down and or changing format to reduce space
- Check for videos bigger than 854width, or with audio, on disk:
  Part3
  Part5
  Part6
  Part8
  Part8_5
  Part9
  Part9_5
  Part11
- Look for instances of more than one of gif/webm/mp4
- Look for unusued images and videos (or also any bad links)

====================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts

Suggestions from tfgames:
- Buridan
  - should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
  - would love more Barry content. A lot of the other neighbours seem to have more content associated with them
  (added recovery) - the kidnapping story branch is... a little dark compared to the rest of the story, which is more typical college stuff. Feels weird for the winter break to happen right after like nothing happened.

Look at Stats
- SexDifferentMaleCount doesn't update during 'Textbook' pledge week path, for example
- Adjust stats calculation for part 10, 11
- Also should adjust implied sex between pages

Kidnapped path
- Change inventory and birth control and job

Pregnancy when Peter is the father
  - from :centerflag982:  On a somewhat related note, I really hope that there will eventually be a distinct pregnancy-reaction scene for when
    Peter's the father, rather than the generic "You know youâ€™ll be on your own..." scene. I mean, the

Earlier Parts:
- Veronica Cheerleader path: Ended up with a dead end after the Veronica cheerleader part where no options from the first classroom pic
  Looks like it was something with setting a variable inside of a Link tag.  Try to eliminate doing that
- (Deciding whether Peter helps you study) : If Hannah is mentor, and you go to the guys room and bring Peter back,
  later it says 'not that close' when seeing if he helps you study, but you've hooked up with him.  Probably similar if you are in
  chastity and blew him, possibliy also if you hook up and Sam is your mentor.
  Maybe less points than if keyholder, but more than just friends
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbour selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbour)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- Add month/year to side bar, pregnancy state

Later
- Statistics page
- Description page
