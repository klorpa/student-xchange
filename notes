TODO BUGS:


In the "BodyOptionalFeatures" passage you have two "<<nobr>" parts that should be "<<nobr>>" instead.

In the "JobWebModel1" passage the 2nd and 3rd <<set>> lines are missing a ")" before the ">>".

In the "Part85Upset1" passage you have one "<<else>><print "He believes you" that's missing a "<" before the <<print>> macro.

In the "Part14Island9" passage you have "<<<</nobr>>" instead of "<</nobr>>" in one spot.

And in your JavaScript you have a bunch of "State.variables." (SugarCube v1 code) which should be "State.variables." (SugarCube v2 code) instead. It only works because SugarCube v2 tries to be backwards compatible with SugarCube v1.

Also, there's an unnecessary "the" in the "Part8JailChastity" passage, where it says, "around the his".

-- Women's studies professor returns if $ProfessorMindControl
----- If report women's studies prof to eng dept, then she comes back supporting school-wide belt program for safety
----- Wearer gets drunk and tries to consent to unlocking but it doesn't let her because of intoxication, she blows him instead and it rewards her, escalates from there

=========
- Added controls to all the videos to pause, rewind, unmute
- Fixed: - flamewind11 : I came across a strange bug, I dated Peter and Paul, the first pregnancy test came in for the options of who could the father be. The options were Peter and some frat guy, I chose to do a sample test. My character got the sample from Peter and the next page said Paul is "NOT the father". My character then breaks up with Paul and Peter for neither of them being the father, I looked into the code and Sugercube states "PregnancyCheck.actualFather" is Peter. I think this bug happens because I'm dating two guys and the game prefers Paul over Peter.
- Fixed: - renenarcisoFlag: There is a bit of laziness in some passages, like when you get pregnant, the text says something like "If you wanted to get pregnant, you're happy, if you didn't, you're horrified." Duh. Either cut this line altogether, or take the time to set a variable to adjust the text to match the player's choice.


- Added option to skip over Christmas (year 1)
- Added option to go to uncles if on ministry path (year 1)
- Added option to max out all side effects
- Added option to not blow mechanic when no money, if you've only had sex with one person (in addition to the other reasons it would allow it)
- Added a continuation for art path if you decide to go back to art modeling and not go with Ken
- Added option to not cuckold Peter

Couldn't duplicate, may have already fixed: 1.14.03 seems to have broken the child names on the Paul path. Once I get to PaulWife8 there's two errors:
Error: <<set>>: bad evaluation: Unexpected identifier
Error: <<set>>: bad evaluation: Cannot read property '1' of undefined
fixed: And one other minor error. In AndrewWedding there's one place where it says Paul instead of Andrew.
fixed: That page also has a couple of really minor word errors:
fixed: - dishevled should be dishevelled
fixed: - "Your legs a quickly tire from dancing with Andrew" shouldn't have the word "a".
fixed: - That particular sentence might read a bit better (and this is my subjective perspective so you might disagree, in which case ignore this) if you added some conjunctions. I'd change it to "and then your father" and " so you let Faith"

================================================================================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- Improving or eliminating academic and fun points ?

Suggestions from tfgames:
- should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
    
Back-end
- Revamping body / side effect system

Earlier Parts:
- Consider eliminating side-jobs from beginning (still have them at the student loan part)
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- consider adding additional side effect from second implant birth control option.  Triggered every time it prevents a pregnancy
