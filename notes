[quote]Any plans for the mentors to join some of the sororities?[/quote]
I didn't have any plans about it, but I'm open to ideas if you had any.

I meant to imply also that there were a number of other sororities on campus as well.  Those just either weren't interested in you, or you weren't interested in them at all.  So it could also be that a mentor ends up in a rival sorority as well.  (Though I still don't have any plans/ideas along those lines.)
———
Someone requested a purple x-change user (or something similar).  Thought about including it, but hard to find content for tg+female (assuming they’d be a hookup or something for the main character)
================================================================================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- Improving or eliminating academic and fun points ?

Suggestions from tfgames:
- should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
    
Back-end
- Revamping body / side effect system

Earlier Parts:
- Consider eliminating side-jobs from beginning (still have them at the student loan part)
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbour selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbour)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- consider adding additional side effect from second implant birth control option.  Triggered every time it prevents a pregnancy
