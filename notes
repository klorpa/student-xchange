====================
Immediate fixes before next release

- Add coords for Part 11 when finished with it
- Bug on Part95Start1  still incorrectly refers to Andrew if Peter's the one coming with you. (See :centerflag982: below from tfgames)
- ? Add month/year to side bar, pregnancy state
- Add a recovery path for the kidnapping escape path.
    - Double check the non-recovery path
- unset PlayerMoneySet after decided about extra money, etc
- with andrew, got option to blow professor but declined, said I passed, but still says I'm on probation

Double check Part10Start with Andrew or Professor and > $0
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	  It makes you feel like a real adult, [[paying your bills off|Part10Responsible]] ahead of time.
In both cases that should be before a line that says, "&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;".

====================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts

Suggestions from tfgames:
- Buridan
  - should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
  - would love more Barry content. A lot of the other neighbors seem to have more content associated with them
  - the kidnapping story branch is... a little dark compared to the rest of the story, which is more typical college stuff. Feels weird for the winter break to happen right after like nothing happened.

Look at Stats
- SexDifferentMaleCount doesn't update during 'Textbook' pledge week path, for example
- Adjust stats calculation for part 10
- Also should adjust implied sex between pages

Kidnapped path
- Change inventory and birth control and job

Pregnancy when Peter is the father
  - from :centerflag982:  On a somewhat related note, I really hope that there will eventually be a distinct pregnancy-reaction scene for when
    Peter's the father, rather than the generic "You know youâ€™ll be on your own..." scene. I mean, the

Earlier Parts:
- Veronica Cheerleader path: Ended up with a dead end after the Veronica cheerleader part where no options from the first classroom pic
  Looks like it was something with setting a variable inside of a Link tag.  Try to eliminate doing that
- (Deciding whether Peter helps you study) : If Hannah is mentor, and you go to the guys room and bring Peter back,
  later it says 'not that close' when seeing if he helps you study, but you've hooked up with him.  Probably similar if you are in
  chastity and blew him, possibliy also if you hook up and Sam is your mentor.
  Maybe less points than if keyholder, but more than just friends
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate

Debug Mode
- add option somewhere to enable/disable debug Mode
- Debug mode re-enables side-effect picker
- Move mentor and neighbor selection to debug mode? (probably just the neighbor)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
