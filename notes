TODO Fixes Needed:
Bug report. From "Discussing your piercing" with Kate:

"When you point out that $Keyholder has the key to your belt, Kate pulls a key out of her purse. "There's two keys, of course.", she tells you. "$Keyholder gave me a copy ages ago. I've just chosen not to use it. We've already discussed your new piercing, and are in agreement on it. Assuming you are too, that is."

I was not wearing a chastity belt, hence why Keyholder is not defined. This paragraph displayed by mistake.

================================================================================
- Other Roommate specific paths
    - Emily: Sharing Room with guy, ?
    - Hannah: ? Something prostitution related
    - Samantha: Lesbian-only path  - Make sure can go through (depending on job, side effects, etc) with only lesbian sex
================
- Possible Future Gameplay Enhancements
  - Change to track horniness.  If you are very horny then you won't turn down sex if offered.
  - Track how you are doing in school.  If you are very horny and don't masturbate or have sex then you can't focus on school and do poorly.  Maybe also work depending on the job
  - Have birth control pills cause side effect (orgasm denial, or increased libido) sometimes
  - Have denial side effect cause you to stop using condoms, withdrawl, or pill

  - Consider failing at your job and ending up at a worse alternative
    - If a bad student: get kicked out of engineering and to a test subject
    - others?
============================================================
Label when you don't get a choice because of your side effects?
============================================================
If I had a wishlist it would be for the Winter Break section to be expanded as it currently feels like it is the most repetetive with the least amount of choices
---------
I think the "story mode" is a good idea, where it's a defined set of options and choices, and also any random values are preset as well. And then it follows that path.

It wouldn't cover every possible outcome, it could send you along to each of the endings.

I'll add that to my future possibilities list.
------

Add story option for veronica + porn star ?
End path for porn star ?
——
Love this game so many paths so many options using side effects only thing I find sad is if u choose full figure u still see fit petite pics but no way does it take away from the overall game can't wait for summer and next school year. Keep up the great work
——
Is there any possibility of the art modelling job ever becoming a real job rather than just a game-over path? The game-over is interesting, once, but results in a meaningless option after you have seen it once. That would have been fine in the original format, but in this form having a game-over branch and a regular branch would be a lot more interesting.
* Back to nude modeling for art classes.  Decide you like it and become a regular model?
----
[quote]Any plans for the mentors to join some of the sororities?[/quote]
I didn't have any plans about it, but I'm open to ideas if you had any.
...So it could also be that a mentor ends up in a rival sorority as well.  (Though I still don't have any plans/ideas along those lines.)
———
Someone requested a purple x-change user (or something similar).  Thought about including it, but hard to find content for tg+female (assuming they’d be a hookup or something for the main character)
================================================================================
Other misc changes, tweaks of older Parts
- Improving or eliminating academic and fun points ?

Suggestions from tfgames:
- should be more side-effects in exchange for some perks - perhaps being able to customize body type for 1 side-effect each?
    
Back-end
- Revamping body / side effect system

Earlier Parts:
- Consider eliminating side-jobs from beginning (still have them at the student loan part)
- Part85Submissive1: Change to make text specific and not "Your Lover"
- Sorority w/Veronica - Sidebar doesn't change roommate (is this fixed now?)

Sidebar
- side effects: Look at text for higher levels.  They don't have any effect currently beyond the base level
- Student Life balance: Change text of different levels.  Can say you are a bad student even if you specifically say you are a good one
- Add item pictures and descriptions to inventory.  (Including situational things ie. "Vibrator: staring at it only reminds you of the orgasms you are denied in your chastity belt")
- consider adding additional side effect from second implant birth control option.  Triggered every time it prevents a pregnancy
