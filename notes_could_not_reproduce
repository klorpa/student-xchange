Could not reproduce 15.0.0
- CapMako: There appears to be a bug with the sorority house party. A few times I've been in chastity (this time's example was as the belt-betatester from the engineering subject path), yet get a scene with a threesome with frat guys. While the sidebar still says "You are currently locked in a computerized chastity belt."

Choosing;
Sounds like fun![2] 
Eww! No![5]
That sounds interesting[6]
The 'Eww! No![5]' fails, and you still get the scene with the guys. - Edit* This may be RNG as after getting the fail several times I was able to get the 2 to run without the 'Eww! No![5]' scene.

I think it has something to do with the order you click the 3 options, but I am unsure.
Me: Unable to reproduce - could possibly be from hitting "1" or "r" and getting the "do them all" option at the top
