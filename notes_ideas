Suggestions:

With Part85Talk1 and your general Peter comments, I'll make a note to consider adding the option to not cuckold Peter if you don't want to.
(Assuming you don't have side-effects or jobs that push you into other choices.)
Regarding: It's not a bug as such, but I tried to do a completely faithful to Peter route and I don't think its possible to get past Valentines Day/Spring Break without cheating. If you're feeling inspired you could add a slightly different path there, as that relationship has a different feel when there's no sleeping around...

2) This version makes a huge step-forward in side effects being relevant and in earning new side effects.
I hope more get added in future, as this adds a lot more interesting things (eg Faith + Anal Love results in 'technically still a virgin' scenes).

(me) At least where Robert is the keyholder, he lets your boss/supervisor/coach have a copy of they so you can be unlocked for work
if necessary for your job, but only for your job.  For some of these it should probably be more clear that is what is happening.

- Other Roommate specific paths
    - Emily: Sharing Room with guy, ?
    - Hannah: ? Something prostitution related
    - Samantha: Lesbian-only path  - Make sure can go through (depending on job, side effects, etc) with only lesbian sex
================
- Possible Future Gameplay Enhancements
  - Change to track horniness.  If you are very horny then you won't turn down sex if offered.
  - Track how you are doing in school.  If you are very horny and don't masturbate or have sex then you can't focus on school and do poorly.  Maybe also work depending on the job
  - Have birth control pills cause side effect (orgasm denial, or increased libido) sometimes
  - Have denial side effect cause you to stop using condoms, withdrawl, or pill

  - Consider failing at your job and ending up at a worse alternative
    - If a bad student: get kicked out of engineering and to a test subject
    - others?
============================================================
Could there be a dominance/domination side effect/skill? It seems like this is already a feature in some storylines, with torturing Peter and Dylan (like you said) and that time you encounter a submissive girl at the lesbian bar, though it seems kinda vanilla compared to the submission stuff. Maybe your character could be the main part in a dominatrix storyline in the second half of the story if you're willing to consider that request?
----
Could Dylan choose to become Diane permanently in the second half of the storyline if he became Diane and enjoyed it in the lesbian bar storyline?
----
It is possible for you to end the summer with you holding Dylan's chastity key I believe.  But he gives you your key back before you leave to return to school, I may change this in the future so that he keeps your key in some situations.
-------
I'll also add to consider an ending scenario where player becomes intersex/etc., that would be more manageable as an ending would have a single or small number of branches to need images/video for.
----
If I had a wishlist it would be for the Winter Break section to be expanded as it currently feels like it is the most repetetive with the least amount of choices
---------
I think the "story mode" is a good idea, where it's a defined set of options and choices, and also any random values are preset as well. And then it follows that path.

It wouldn't cover every possible outcome, it could send you along to each of the endings.

I'll add that to my future possibilities list.

Add story option for veronica + porn star ?
End path for porn star ?

Love this game so many paths so many options using side effects only thing I find sad is if u choose full figure u still see fit petite pics but no way does it take away from the overall game can't wait for summer and next school year. Keep up the great work

Is there any possibility of the art modelling job ever becoming a real job rather than just a game-over path? The game-over is interesting, once, but results in a meaningless option after you have seen it once. That would have been fine in the original format, but in this form having a game-over branch and a regular branch would be a lot more interesting.
* Back to nude modeling for art classes.  Decide you like it and become a regular model?

[quote]Any plans for the mentors to join some of the sororities?[/quote]
I didn't have any plans about it, but I'm open to ideas if you had any.
...So it could also be that a mentor ends up in a rival sorority as well.  (Though I still don't have any plans/ideas along those lines.)

Someone requested a purple x-change user (or something similar).  Thought about including it, but hard to find content for tg+female (assuming they’d be a hookup or something for the main character)
