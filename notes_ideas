TODO Bugs:

- (user:Winterized) One really weird variable combination I ran into. Had the MC as an engineer and in a relationship with Aaron where he was keyholder. But, the Eric chastity events happened as normal. Not only that, but the game continued, without any kind of conflict and with events for both that didn't make any sense at that point.
- Etceterotica: if you wind up in a chastity belt permanently, you get the "guy dumps you because he wants a family page" ... with Bailey.

TODO Definitely add for next release:
--------
- Etceterotica: (Concerns about father character and upset about lack of agency at begining if inform parents)
  Me: I'm not a fan of the father character either, but hadn't considered how he and this new content might be personally upsetting for someone. I'll update the intro for the next release or patch to make it more clear what kind of a person your father is and that you should avoid this option if that's going to bother you.
  & I may also give the player a "f*** off" option right at the beginning if you start to tell him and then don't like his instructions after that. That option will require me to come up with some alternate content for Christmas and summer breaks though, so that option might take longer to add.
  -- dialogue like "You're not sure if you want to tell your family given how your dad might react, he's very controlling and would take your choices away" on the first page would at least give the player (especially a NEW player who hasn't replayed the game like I have) a chance to make an informed decision.
  




In Progress:
------------
  - Dorms - If conflict then may end up either reconciling or having to switch rooms and ending up with a guy
  - Women's Studies professor
  
Add, but not started yet
------------
Peter - Hot Wife Ending
Peter - Chastity, but no cuckold ending
Engineering/TestSubject - More cases where chastity belt leads to being owned

Continuing
----------
- Make sure there remains a Peter no-cuck path (MFF, but no MMF, or sex with other guys) (Faith as roommate, barista, no side effects)
- Make sure there remains a gold-star lesbian path (Sam as roommate, no side effects)
- Continue with Andrew cuckqueen with Kiera/Marissa
- Part15ThirdTrimester
- Part15Delivery
- More with Dylan's chastity key
- If $MarissaNoSmoke eventually starts smoking in room again, and conflict
- follow ups with FWB or threesome
- if you and roommate don't get along, something later in the year
- Add more Anal when $LoopholeVirgin, during second year and maybe during summer
- Eric relationship

- After week 14
-- Women's studies professor returns if $ProfessorMindControl
----- If report women's studies prof to eng dept, then she comes back supporting school-wide belt program for safety
----- Wearer gets drunk and tries to consent to unlocking but it doesn't let her because of intoxication, she blows him instead and it rewards her, escalates from there
-- follow up on women's studies if she was reported to the eng dept, or if she is publishing her study (and you didn't come forward)
-- if $WomensStudiesProfessorPublish then several weeks later she publishes.  Locked in belt with BJ setting for months (but not permanent) if belted.
-- Occasional engineering visits if $EngineeringGuest
-- Valentines day - special with Eric
-- Something (a different side effect?) if you get pregnant from Dylan?
-- Email/Letter/Phone call later with Justin
-- additional collar upgrades later
-- wedding to Kate (at end of y2-semester 1)
-- PlayerSideEffectOrgasmBlock treatment (as in flunk ending)
-- Continue path for entire time in chastity belt


Likely:
------------
  - (eg Faith + Anal Love results in 'technically still a virgin' scenes)
  - More dominant content.  Player a dominatrix  (Porn Star path or Call Girl Path)
  - Gold-star lesbian path (Samantha as mentor and then bar job, etc. Maybe also with art/model job)
  - Add additional treatments later if $PlayerCumTreatments set
  - More buddy related achievements: (Bound together? Her and You in chastity together, both pregnant from a threesome)
  - Option to have neighbor as boyfriend with other roommates (currently only Faith and Emily I think)
  - Chance of getting pregnant from bad aim/leakage/etc if on anal-only
  - Also end up with Justin if NOT expelled and have the option of dropping out and marrying him, or breaking up

============================
Maybe:
------------
  - More side effect or results from side effects
  - Have birth control pills cause side effect (orgasm denial, or increased libido) sometimes
  - It is possible for you to end the summer with you holding Dylan's chastity key I believe.  But he gives you your key back before you leave to return to school, I may change this in the future so that he keeps your key in some situations.
  - Add story option for veronica + porn star
  - More use of different photos for alternate body types
  - Future interactions with mentors.  One is in a rival sorority for example
  - "Portal panty" simulation with electonic chasity belt. (Guys have sex toy remotely linked that stimulates your belt)
  - Dylan accidently becoming Diane permanently in other lesbian bar paths, similar to with Kate ending
  - Engineering? Design a womanizer-style sex toy that locks on to a piercing and can't be removed by you until unlocked by someone controlling it
  - if graduate with Criminal Justice degree - undercover cop and end up with similar scene to the gang initiation with Emilio
  - Electronic belts detect ovulation/fertile period and alert owner when they should unlock to conceive
  - Electronic belts can prevent wearing of clothing over it. (Maybe set that way as an advertisement?)
  - Electronic belts Option for Anal->Vaginal Redirection and impregnation
  - Do something if have multiple chastity keys
  - Dylan with chastity after summer.  Roommate or X-Change for him (cage falls off when he changes.  He has to put it back on with the key inside of it, so it can only come off with another X-Change pill
  - Add random, "don't have a tampon" event if on period
  - Dealing with cheerleading if on period
  - BF/GF gets the key to Bailey's belt if they have yours
  - Mention robert occasional cleaning sessions where he teases you but doesn't let you get off.
  - Make sure no conflict between Bailey and Eric ?
  - Affect thoughts during Later events, if were previously raped
  - mizunoj: kinda hate how orgasm denial gets automatically countered, without a choice, towards pregnancy things.
    me: For the orgasm denial side effect, I'll add a note to possibly add an option to just regularly take the "treatment" drinks instead.
  - daisycyoas: If you're looking for ideas for optional content you could add some risky experimental therapies to try to get rid of certain side effects or traits acquired during the game, e.g. the exhibitionist trait gained through the librarian job. Those risks could be:
    - random chance the therapy fails with no effect or even a negative effect of gaining another side effect or a worse version of the trait we were trying to get rid of.  
    - getting in debt to pay for the therapy. Could also have a riskier alternative therapy that's free. 
    - getting kidnapped by evil scientists involved in the therapy, possibly a bad end too. 
    - side effect specific risks like some shady guy offering to cure the erotic dreams side effect with hypnosy and using that as an opportunity to take advantage of their hypnotised victim.
  - I'd love to see a power flip with Bailey where YOU start on top and gradually things change over the semester so she's topping you at the end, by picking up enough submissive traits?
  - Allow to go 'no contact' with father at start of game. Would need to replace christmas/summer - no returning to parents,calls with father, minimumal contact with mother, more visits from brother and sister

============================
Postponed, maybe return to it after game is completed:
- Story mode (Postponed), maybe a replay mode that others can make instead
Re-enable story mode later when things are stable, verify existing endings and add all endings

============================
Future Endings:
- W/Veronica
- Ending with Jayden
- Cuck queen additional ending (with roommate from year 2 as Cuckcake)

-------
University Backstory
- X-Change donating to university and bribing officials to look the other way on issues, paying off people so they don't complain
- Engineering department developing sex toys
- Engineering department test subjects to sex slaves

-----------
Other suggestions:
- A personal favourite would be a cheerleader to an athlete story for sure.


bondage clip art: https://www.123rf.com/clipart-vector/bondage.html?sti=lbraph88m94axsz4vo|

should probably verify all achievements and endings still possible

=========

AllOfThem:
One thing that I wouldn't mind seeing would be more refusal options during the side effects bonanza.

Specifically the easy/powerful orgasms side effects, which currently have no refusal options.

Now, I get it - why would anyone refuse such side effects? More pleasure for free!

But well, the player PoV can be somewhat different, and I feel like there are in-character reasons one might refuse (or be refused) those:
the player character is of the Faith variety and would rather not be led astray
the player doesn't get a choice - it's a medical test program, after all. Excessive orgasm effects could negatively affect results, therefore the program runners say 'No' in the player character's stead. Could be paired with a cash bonus. Choose the cash bonus before the side effects (simple checkbox on a preceding page, I imagine), lose your chance at many super orgasms... unless two side effect cancellers are already in effect. Positive side effects and the money, suck it, bitches
I thought about maybe also making it a parental choice, but implementation would probably be considerably more complicated, so eh.


renee98 :
Barry path updates
I found the path where Barry 'forces' you on the island. Instantly one of my favourites. The only thing that has been bothering me about it as that he suggests you know his character enough to know it was a trick, but on Faith's path you only interact with him at the first meeting.

My suggestion would be to have a few opportunities along the way to submit to Barry, but not in a sexual manner. Simply him asking/demanding you do a few things for him and you do them, for e.g. helping him move things, cooking him something. Maybe he buys an outfit for a 'girlfriend' and asks you to try it on because you have the same body-shape (the outfit could even be one he makes you wear after the island) or demands you clean his room where you stumble upon bondage equipment he left for you to find.

This way I feel the character would have been manipulated enough to a) go along on a trip with him, and b) actually secretly know what you're getting involved in. While I know us as player obviously know what the island is, your PC seems to jump the gun a bit IMO.

(It would also be cool but harder to implement if eventually faith was brought into the relationship as well as another pet.)

Cleaning his room (for cash or to repay a favor), find handcuffs or something similar and play with them, get stuck, Barry plays with you a bit and you can submit or not
Maybe movie not, but it ends up being a soft-core porn (slave pics from /newpics/b ?
- Halloween seeing him with another girl

ALSO: Me to renee98:  I’ll add a note for later to consider corrupting faith in some way with Barry or otherwise.

NetDenizen1147:
Well, different people view Incest in different ways. I personally like the idea of romantic incest, family love changing to romantic and sexual love, so the possibility of some kind of relationship forming between the player and their brother would appeal to me, especially if that relationship resulted in or was created as a result of a pregnancy. More outright choices to pursue sex with Dylan, sexting from the dorm room, etc.



UsagiTripleSix:
I feel like this (quickly getting porn-payoff) is one area where this “game” far excels over others.
Way too many games are really slow-burns, or just become endless teases (my own game being utterly
guilty of these), while this one has quick “payoff” without coming across as completely jarring.

Is it just me, though? I actually found the beginning section where you choose your options and
discover the side-effects to be the hottest part of the whole thing. :lol: It’s what got me invested
in the first place.

It does bring me to my main gripe, which is that I wish it was more obvious what the different
side-effects were doing, and that they were played up a bit more. I’m assuming many of them just
result in the player character automatically hooking up when there might’ve been an option,
otherwise, but I’d think something like having multiple levels of “super-easy-orgasm” would
have a dramatic impact on some sex events.

It’s been a really long time since I last played it, though, so I’m just going from memory.
...
This game introduced me to the X-change pill concept. At first, I thought the game was a
reference to the Japanese VN series of X-Change games. I love the concept, even if the
simplicity makes it harder to suspend disbelief.

As far as revisiting older parts of the game, goes… Since replayability seems like a strong
point (especially with trying out different side-effects), what I’d love to see is more
“width” added to the beginning. By that, I mean there are certain parts of the game that
have started to feel like a slog on repeat play-throughs (going home to see your family,
for instance). It’d be great to have more alternatives in the sections everyone has to go
through repeatedly.

Anyway, I'll be excited to check out the next update. :D

Add me to the "excited to see it's still being worked on" group. I love the branching
options and all the different endings.
Hopefully there are more fully Lesbian options in the update as well!
