TODO Issues/Tweaks

- Me/T7792's question about LoopholeViolation: This is triggered if you get pregnant after only ever having had anal sex.  I think I need to tweak things a bit because I'm not sure this is possible right now.  I was intending for it to be possible when you are on the Faith/virginal path either with Barry as your roommate or if you start dating Andrew at spring break.  But I'm not sure it currently gives you the option correctly.

- T7792: birth control pills feel like they are useless, chances for pregnancy feel similar to using no protection.  This appears to be something that has happened with the update, as they were fairly effective before.
  Me:  I'll take a look.  I may need to tweak the odds a bit for the pill.

- T7792: (possible browser issue), the game runs really slow when going to the male prison.  The female prison works fine, but I can be waiting up to 10 seconds after a click for the screen to change at the male one.
  Me: Slowness at men's prison: This is probably due to the "sex" array that keeps track of all your sexual encounters.  Either the size of it is causing an issue or just adding all the sex the character has had between pages is probably what is slowing your browser down.  I'll try to take a look at this and see if I can improve things.

- T7792: The cat-girl achievement is linked to the post prison cat-girl ending.  The problem is that there is another cat-girl ending with no achievement, the one where you are submissive, and you get kidnapped.  You are also more catlike in that ending.
  Me: I'll take a look and see if I need to tweak anything - possibly to make the kidnapping version less catgirl-like

- T7792: Next, something I assume you plan to change, but if not may want to look at.  In year 2 the relationships with your partners feels very generic, this is particularly true with Barry (until you get on his wife routes) and Paul.  
  Me: I agree, some of them need some attention in a future update.

Walkthrough/Guide
----------------
Is there a walkthrough for all the different endings and achievements?

In Progress:
------------
  - Dorms - If conflict then may end up either reconciling or having to switch rooms and ending up with a guy
  - Women's Studies professor
  
Add, but not started yet
------------
Peter - Hot Wife Ending
Peter - Chastity, but no cuckold ending
Engineering/TestSubject - More cases where chastity belt leads to being owned

Continuing
----------
- Make sure there remains a Peter no-cuck path (MFF, but no MMF, or sex with other guys) (Faith as roommate, barista, no side effects)
- Make sure there remains a gold-star lesbian path (Sam as roommate, no side effects)
- Continue with Andrew cuckqueen with Kiera/Marissa
- Part15ThirdTrimester
- Part15Delivery
- More with Dylan's chastity key
- If $MarissaNoSmoke eventually starts smoking in room again, and conflict
- follow ups with FWB or threesome
- if you and roommate don't get along, something later in the year
- Add more Anal when $LoopholeVirgin, during second year and maybe during summer
- Eric relationship

- After week 14
-- Women's studies professor returns if $ProfessorMindControl
----- If report women's studies prof to eng dept, then she comes back supporting school-wide belt program for safety
----- Wearer gets drunk and tries to consent to unlocking but it doesn't let her because of intoxication, she blows him instead and it rewards her, escalates from there
-- follow up on women's studies if she was reported to the eng dept, or if she is publishing her study (and you didn't come forward)
-- if $WomensStudiesProfessorPublish then several weeks later she publishes.  Locked in belt with BJ setting for months (but not permanent) if belted.
-- Occasional engineering visits if $EngineeringGuest
-- Valentines day - special with Eric
-- Something (a different side effect?) if you get pregnant from Dylan?
-- Email/Letter/Phone call later with Justin
-- additional collar upgrades later
-- wedding to Kate (at end of y2-semester 1)
-- PlayerSideEffectOrgasmBlock treatment (as in flunk ending)
-- Continue path for entire time in chastity belt


Likely:
------------
  - Skip option for the summer break
  - (eg Faith + Anal Love results in 'technically still a virgin' scenes)
  - More dominant content.  Player a dominatrix  (Porn Star path or Call Girl Path)
  - Gold-star lesbian path (Samantha as mentor and then bar job, etc. Maybe also with art/model job)
  - Add additional treatments later if $PlayerCumTreatments set
  - More buddy related achievements: (Bound together? Her and You in chastity together, both pregnant from a threesome)
  - Option to have neighbor as boyfriend with other roommates (currently only Faith and Emily I think)
  - Chance of getting pregnant from bad aim/leakage/etc if on anal-only
  - Also end up with Justin if NOT expelled and have the option of dropping out and marrying him, or breaking up
  - Add JobEngineer1 "persuade" to be come engineer to list of possible cross-examination events
  - Slywa: rather than skips, it'd probably be most useful to have a set of options for starting at summer. Especially as content goes into 2nd year, that'd let people more easily explore the different options for new content. It could probably be implemented as essentially built-in saves.
============================
Maybe:
------------
  - More side effect or results from side effects
  - Maybe random chance for extra, intended side effects from father's selections
  - Have birth control pills cause side effect (orgasm denial, or increased libido) sometimes
  - It is possible for you to end the summer with you holding Dylan's chastity key I believe.  But he gives you your key back before you leave to return to school, I may change this in the future so that he keeps your key in some situations.
  - Add story option for veronica + porn star
  - More use of different photos for alternate body types
  - Future interactions with mentors.  One is in a rival sorority for example
  - "Portal panty" simulation with electonic chasity belt. (Guys have sex toy remotely linked that stimulates your belt)
  - Dylan accidently becoming Diane permanently in other lesbian bar paths, similar to with Kate ending
  - Engineering? Design a womanizer-style sex toy that locks on to a piercing and can't be removed by you until unlocked by someone controlling it
  - if graduate with Criminal Justice degree - undercover cop and end up with similar scene to the gang initiation with Emilio
  - Electronic belts detect ovulation/fertile period and alert owner when they should unlock to conceive
  - Electronic belts can prevent wearing of clothing over it. (Maybe set that way as an advertisement?)
  - Electronic belts Option for Anal->Vaginal Redirection and impregnation
  - Do something if have multiple chastity keys
  - Dylan with chastity after summer.  Roommate or X-Change for him (cage falls off when he changes.  He has to put it back on with the key inside of it, so it can only come off with another X-Change pill
  - Add random, "don't have a tampon" event if on period
  - Dealing with cheerleading if on period
  - BF/GF gets the key to Bailey's belt if they have yours
  - Mention robert occasional cleaning sessions where he teases you but doesn't let you get off.
  - Make sure no conflict between Bailey and Eric ?
  - Affect thoughts during Later events, if were previously raped
  - mizunoj: kinda hate how orgasm denial gets automatically countered, without a choice, towards pregnancy things.
    me: For the orgasm denial side effect, I'll add a note to possibly add an option to just regularly take the "treatment" drinks instead.
  - daisycyoas: If you're looking for ideas for optional content you could add some risky experimental therapies to try to get rid of certain side effects or traits acquired during the game, e.g. the exhibitionist trait gained through the librarian job. Those risks could be:
    - random chance the therapy fails with no effect or even a negative effect of gaining another side effect or a worse version of the trait we were trying to get rid of.  
    - getting in debt to pay for the therapy. Could also have a riskier alternative therapy that's free. 
    - getting kidnapped by evil scientists involved in the therapy, possibly a bad end too. 
    - side effect specific risks like some shady guy offering to cure the erotic dreams side effect with hypnosy and using that as an opportunity to take advantage of their hypnotised victim.
  - I'd love to see a power flip with Bailey where YOU start on top and gradually things change over the semester so she's topping you at the end, by picking up enough submissive traits?
  - Allow to go 'no contact' with father at start of game. Would need to replace christmas/summer - no returning to parents,calls with father, minimumal contact with mother, more visits from brother and sister
  - comment: Which can also lead to Engineering chastity thread where you are literally being trained to be your "husband's" permanently chaste sex slave. Which, i think might also lead one to be trained for bondage and sexy clothes, just as an idea.
  - subcas: Cool. Even though the Paul one is an official ending. I would love if it were extended it get revenge on the ex-wife!
  - LittleCupcake02: A little suggestion considering pure: If choosing the friendly fraternity. How about a couple good samaritan getting guilt tripped whilst helping the community? Or taken advantage of choices?  Ahem hobo gangbang for example?
  - mizunoj: suggestion on the Faith Pure: wife training chastity path; if you have the implant that prevents pregnancy, then an ending where you end up similar to the Kyle "Stepford Wife" except, you know, free of your own mind and still wanting to orgasm, but permanently denied, willing to please your husband with kinky clothing and bondage. Especially latex, if you chose Fashion for major.  Because, you know, if "i should only be unlocked to be impregnated" and you can't get pregnant, therefore you should never get unlocked..- I may also give the player a "f*** off" option right at the beginning if you start to tell him and then don't like his instructions after that. That option will require me to come up with some alternate content for Christmas and summer breaks though, so that option might take longer to add.

Winterized:
Kate content this update wasn't especially substantial. Mostly because a lot of the new or focused content this update was on the engineering/chastity, on Academic Probation, on new jobs, on the women's studies class, and on the Buddy. Of those system's, the only one she interacts with besides a very brief buddy one off, is the probation system. But, the new Kate ending feels like a legit missed mark. Mostly because in terms of sexual content it's 2/3rds built around Dylan, who gets more numerous and lengthy passages then Kate. But, honestly I play this game for the female chastity+ BDSM not the tf, so the lezdom ending with more tf then lezdom was a huge clunker. Maybe less so for someone more into TF. But, just on the level of good story sense, if the focus of a route is mostly on the PC + Kate relationship then the most important task of the ending is tosome kind of closure.

In terms of specific actionable feedback. I don't think the Dylan stuff in the ending is bad, in of itself. It's more the absence of what should be in there. It needs at least a few (Obviously I'd like more then a few, and she is a popular character. But there's only so much writing that can be done) passages exploring the core questions?

What does their life together look like? Now that there's no constraints on a real life for the PC, how does it evolve? Full time Lesbian Pet? 1950s housewife but Gay? Dylan becomes her pet too? You break up and find a new Mistress? You get inseminated to have a kid? Kate gets bored of being a Domme and becomes a sub to someone else? There's a lot of really good options of you're ever in the mood to expand it and give it some teeth.

Of the ones I mentioned "24/7 Pet" and "Lesbian 50s Wife" work best with the dropout theme, while the others aren't dropout specific. And Dylan threesome works best with the stuff you did with him in the ending already. But, it's all suggests and I'm sure you actually have already had plenty of good or even better ideas on the subject.

Winterized:
Okay. So, I am now reasonably sure I got all of the major content this release. Though if I don't comment on something important feel free to ask/comment and I'll see if I missed it.

First, the sorority party has all sorts of bugs, and all the sexual encounters in it didn't really do a good job accounting for chastity. There were scenes where My charachter was in a cyber belt and baily was in chastity but they were still "going orgasm to orgasm".

Here's my full feedback:

It's a good release with a ton of content. Two years of work would sort of demand it would be. Though, one does get the impression it wasn't two years of continuous progress. Still, it was COVID, no one can be blamed for that.

What I Like:

With a game this big the obvious area where things might live or die is just in focus. To do every route with the same level of meticulous detail would be murderously difficult. But, the spots where attention has been paid all really feel it:

- The buddy program works, and the character of Baily is a clever addition. She's sort of a sort of "mini-me" kind of character, and by virtue of that comes across with more personality than most of the cast. The notion of "shaping" is also fun, adding a clearer area where the game can both reflect the player's transformation and give the player a bit of agency.

- The changes to Faith are great for the most part. There's a bit of a lull around the middle of Semester 1 if you don't have Barry as a roomate. But, the semester 2 "good girl chastity" stuff all lands well and is well done. Same with the Andrew variant of it. But, the real MVP is Barry, which is hilarious because it's such a random variable. But, the multiple temptation scenes make for great buildup. It also does a great job repurposing the pet vacation into something of an act climax, before moving to the unified Act 2. The Mike variant was fun. All in all, really strong additions.

- All the stuff pertaining to the engineering job, both as a subject and as an engineer are just great. A lot of fun was had here, and its setup for more great stuff in version 16. The Engineer versions are slightly better than the Pure, Andrew, Peter, and Tester versions, if only because there was more conflict/challenge there. Both of the Engineer Academic Probation bad ends are among my favorite stuff in the entire thing. But, the Eric stuff isn't bad either. It's definitely the highlight of the update.

- There's a lot of fun to be had with the Academic probation stuff and dropout mechanics. Maid was fun a fun one off. Tutoring was dull but fine-ish. The extended dropout ending sequence was overall pretty good, and one of the only areas where permanent transformation really seemed the matter. In terms of the charachter specific dropouts, Barry was a clear winner, if only because him ditching the PC to f*** the maid is a "barry move".

- Some of the jobs were given really good stuff. Besides Engineering, Model's expansion was also pretty fun and did a lot with the material. It feels like it should be slightly less linear. But, I do appreciate the fact that it has direction. Cheerleader got some good stuff. The stripper ending is fun. Library SEEMS like it's going in a fun direction, but you've only really done the settup for it.

- I'mma hold back my thoughts on the teacher investigation mini-plot, just because it seems that some versions aren't altogether done. But, I'll mostly say I like what I got so far and it seems alright.

- Skip function is a big step up. But, for searching around for material, it might be better if you allowed a single choice on the player's choice regarding uncle mike. Because it defaulted to him a lot, and it has potential to mess with a bunch of routes. If you want to add the skip function to anything, do it to the Spring Break segment. That shit is the bane of a completionist's existence. It's long, has very little plot relevance, It's filled with choices that don't allow for easy skipping but none of those choices have much long term impact. Easy skip option. (Or just add a version where you don't go on spring break besides the relationship ones and the pure one. Something like spend it studying.)

- Overall, while I'm not personally a fan of expanded gender TF stuff, that's just me talking. From a writer's perspective, I can see why you leaned on it a little more this time around, and the update is probably stronger for it. So long as I can continue to *mostly* avoid it or at least the most dramatic aspects of it, it's all fine to me. But, I can definitly see it as a stronger move.

What I thought could use improvement:

- While it makes sense to make the buddy a singular charachter with the same attributes each time. I did come out feeling like the influence options weren't quite what I wanted. The point of the charachter is as kind of a mirror, so she's a good spot to add more choices. In particular, I didn't like that when I was doing the pure route(s) that she always ended up a cock hungry gobbler. I feel as if there should be choices to influence her towards being more conservative. The only situations where I actually felt I had any influence at all were the routes where she became the characters GF, chastity related content, and turning her gay or not. Some things that might be fun could also be some ability to push her towards different times of stuff (Rough sex vs pet play vs humiliation and degredation vs etc etc). Another might be a chance to change her style slightly while picking clothes. Maybe make the player always pick clothes for her, and give the player the option to move her towards diffrent styles sort of like what the mentor does at the start of Year 1? Like, you can pick between conservative/slutty/etc. But, also maybe if you meet certain conditions (Roomed with Olivia or are slave of Kate) can push her towards kink clothing. Stuff like that which improves the "customization" vibe.

- Faith content is mostly great, but it has the potential to have a very abrupt feeling end if you break off the chastity. It needs to give her one more appearance where she can twist the knife of the MC's failure a bit. Really emphasize that fall from grace.

- Actually, just generally, giving the Year 1 mentor a one segment re-appearance to say high and reflect on how much shit had changed would be cool. They all kinda vanish, despite being some of the most fleshed out charachters, and they'd make a nice baromater for progress.

- With the exception of the buddy, who has a good deal of personality, I wasn't taken by any of the new relationship options. Jayden is very boring so far, and I didn't get a single personality detail from him that stuck. Justin has the military thing, but he's eh too. Eric is better, because he has more personality. The mischevious aspect, the engineer/nerd aspect, having a built in kink with the chastity stuff. But, quite frankly, he's not that great either. Ironically, I actually thought that Kyle was a lot better than Eric. That's because Kyle had an actual motive. He was jealous about the way that the MC got special treatment/acted superior and was trying to bring her down a peg. But, Eric doesn't really have that? Quite frankly, Eric might benefit signfigantly from being folded into Kyle slightly so they're the same character? But, he also could benefit from contrasting with Kyle more too, perhaps showing their diffrent methods and outlooks on the MC? Because, right now Eric is just "more boring Kyle"

- I was pretty underwhelmed by the character specific Dropout and academic probation endings. Barry had the best one, but even it was a very qualified positive. The Kate one in particular rankled me, for the reasons I mentioned in my earlier post (Why is the Kate ending like 50%/60% Dylan?). But, overall the impression I got is that they didn't really ask the question "If my character dropped out, how would that change her relationship". The Kate one in particular is noticeable, because the ending seems like it's exactly the same as if she didn't drop out. But, it feels like there should be more substantial changes in their relationship that would happen over time if the player became totally dependent on Kate. The same is true for the other versions too, but less so. Like, I get the impression that Barry would have exploited her more then we saw, though overall it was fine. It's Kate in particular that really stood out to me as a flop.

- The game doesn't really respond to the orgasm block from probation very well, outside of the chastity routes. There's some variables here and there. But, it feels like it should reflect more of a shift in the relationships. Like, Kate goes through all the trouble of getting her own cyber belt for the MC, and she shrugs off the fact that the MC can't cum? There's a lot of potential for it with some of the other routes too. Will elaborate in content ideas.

- I'll mention roommates briefly, because I didn't get a lot this release. But, the impression I get is that is mostly a case of "more is planned". However, I will say that while the nerd roommate and the stoner roommate fill a clearer gap in terms of characters, the slut roommate feels too much like the slut roommate from Year 1. When you do expand her, try to focus on what makes her not a retread.

- I like most of the job stuff, there's some problem areas. Bikini Barrista felt eh to me, with the exception of the "temptation" version of the pure route where it works better. It fails mainly because, by the point you're a rampaging sex machine at the start of year 2, it's rather on the tame side. I didn't try all the job variants. I will say that the call girl scenes were kinda eh to me. Also they probably needed to be more player responsive. Just because it felt odd that my character with points in submission was going around doming people.

- Prior relationships. This is the area where I felt the update was most "incomplete". The relationship segments for Veronica, Kate, Aaron, Non-Dominant Peter, Barry, and Josh felt like they were in "maitance" mode during this stretch of game. The scenes for them were very small and didn't feature changes in status quo. Barry also felt much "tamer" then his asshole self from Year 1. The ones who can co-exist with probation (Josh, Kate, Barry) didn't really respond to the MC losing ability to orgasm. I do get, at least on some level, that this stretch of the game is really more about introducing the new story elements (Women's Studies, Buddy Program, Job Changes, Probation, Chastity Shenanigans). But, I would like a bit more with them in the areas where it's well supported. How are the living conditions having moved in with Barry different then moving in with Josh?

But, the biggest slam against this stretch is that too many of the scenes were identical based on partner. The identical haloween sex scenes in particular stood out as an area where deviation was trimmed in a way with negative impacts. Same with the "copy & paste" versions of the buddy threesome. A threesome with Barry, a threesome with Aaron, and a threesome with Josh should all feel very diffrent from each other, or else it risks the characters not feeling different enough.

- I get not overloading the game with "new parent" stuff. But, it does feel kind of odd how *completely* the child vanishes after giving birth. If you want the pregnancy system to be meaningful, you can give it a bit more. At least a solid passage or two.

- This is a small thing. But, it's too easy to get pregnant, if the player is on the pill. The probability is way fucked, and I swear that she's getting knocked up every semester, even on the pill.

- I see the point of the "what else is going on this week" mini options near the bottom and they're not bad. But, they really do need to be kept to very small stuff. Like a few sentences max. There was a time you tried to fit whole ass passages there and it was just too small to support it. Also, anything that took actual mental processing felt disjointed because it was in the same passage segment as something unrelated.

Suggestions for Further Development:

- This one is obvious. Smaller, shorter release cycles. A release is perfectly fine, even if you don't advance the week cycle that much. I get you felt you had to do the entire first half of the semester in one go. But, it's alright to just note where the cut off point for certain contents bit are, and then just do them one at a time.

- It feels like the variable spam in the game is getting pretty nasty, and more of it needs to be tied in loose ends. I actually really appreciate some stuff like Stripper, Web Model, and Master Robert routes coming endings. Because it feels like the game should start cleaning up variables, so it doesn't become too behemoth to ever write. Some of the major relationships should be looking to reach an ending. Either a "this relationship ends" or a "fast forward to an ending" type of option. Off the top of my head:

Andrew into a proposal that either sends the player down the existing endings, plus a fast forward type deal for the Andrew Cyber-Chastity Plot.
Barry Pet (post-island) can probably start heading towards an accelerated ending. Otherwise, a breakup style situation, like he dumps you because he gets bored of you and he's a fickle bitch.
Aaron and Kate (could) both use more story content, provided you decide on what to do with them (see next point). But, they're also both rapidly approaching a point where you can fast forward a bit to give them a proper ending. They're both some of my favorite routes, so it would be a shame to close them off. But, if you really don't have a lot more to do with them in terms of plot movement, you might as well.
Josh is boring. He is very very boring. I get you need a vanilla guy in there. But, there's plenty of chances to introduce a more interesting vanilla character. So he's another good target for a "marry and fast forward OR breakup" type deal.
Peter and Veronica though, both are in a good spot for sustaining their stories.

- I think a lot of the issues you're running into with the romance partners, is that a lot of them just aren't really interesting enough as charachters to really stay around after they finished their basic deal.

Barry is basically a one note character, and his one note is that he's an asshole who likes humiliating you. But, that's essentially reached it's climax with the BDSM Island plotline. Now what? He doesn't have hobbies, he doesn't have a major or aspirations, he doesn't have any external relationships with other characters, his view of the protaganist as a fuckpet doesn't really evolve. You COULD do an entire arc about Barry emotionally evolving to care about the protagonist as a human being. Showing almost tsundere moments of kindness amidst the abuse, until he eventually works his way into a good Master. But, he doesn't have that kind of character detail yet.

I think a lot of character kind of hit a doldrum because they ran out of material that their broad archetype can sustain. Like, suppose the player and Kate get married. What happens then? What does Kate do for a living? What about her relationship to other women? What does she want out of life? What does she want out of a partner? Is she the type who'd cheat? The type who'd be too controlling? The type who uses her own strength to hide emotional vulnerabilities? Yadda yadda yadda.

And Aaron? Why does he have a tendency to go for younger women? How much of his affection is genuine and kind? How does he feel about being a university professor? Is he happy with it? What does he like to do for fun? There's a lot of potential to do some fun stuff with the fact that he's a university professor and probably a smart guy. How does he respond to diffrent versions of the protaganist? Does he prefer a smart schoolgirl who understands his work? Or does he secretly prefer a dumb girl who he can lecture a bit too?

Eric in particular, I think, has a lot of potential. I suggested combining him with Kyle before, just because Kyle has a clear motivation in his intial jealousy and loathing of the protaganist. But if you don't, it might be better to up the contrast and have him *like* the MC, even while keeping her a fuckpet. There's a lot of potential, in that this is the only route where they're both nerds. You can give them some real chemistry in the fact that that they're colleagues at the exact same time that he's slave training her with the belt. Either posative romantic chemistry, or negative loathing "rival" energy. But, just generally you can do a lot more with it.

Basically, it will be a lot easier to keep the storylines of some of these people going for another 3 in-game years worth of material, if you can make them more intiresting as human beings and make their motives more complex and evolving.

TLDR: Liked Chastity, Purity, and Buddy. Didn't like expansions on old relationships. Think the characters need to be more defined and more routes need closing.
-----

============================
Postponed, maybe return to it after game is completed:
- Story mode (Postponed), maybe a replay mode that others can make instead
Re-enable story mode later when things are stable, verify existing endings and add all endings

============================
Future Endings:
- W/Veronica
- Ending with Jayden
- Cuck queen additional ending (with roommate from year 2 as Cuckcake)

-------
University Backstory
- X-Change donating to university and bribing officials to look the other way on issues, paying off people so they don't complain
- Engineering department developing sex toys
- Engineering department test subjects to sex slaves

-----------
Other suggestions:
- A personal favourite would be a cheerleader to an athlete story for sure.


bondage clip art: https://www.123rf.com/clipart-vector/bondage.html?sti=lbraph88m94axsz4vo|

should probably verify all achievements and endings still possible

AllOfThem:
One thing that I wouldn't mind seeing would be more refusal options during the side effects bonanza.

Specifically the easy/powerful orgasms side effects, which currently have no refusal options.

Now, I get it - why would anyone refuse such side effects? More pleasure for free!

But well, the player PoV can be somewhat different, and I feel like there are in-character reasons one might refuse (or be refused) those:
the player character is of the Faith variety and would rather not be led astray
the player doesn't get a choice - it's a medical test program, after all. Excessive orgasm effects could negatively affect results, therefore the program runners say 'No' in the player character's stead. Could be paired with a cash bonus. Choose the cash bonus before the side effects (simple checkbox on a preceding page, I imagine), lose your chance at many super orgasms... unless two side effect cancellers are already in effect. Positive side effects and the money, suck it, bitches
I thought about maybe also making it a parental choice, but implementation would probably be considerably more complicated, so eh.


renee98 :
Barry path updates
I found the path where Barry 'forces' you on the island. Instantly one of my favourites. The only thing that has been bothering me about it as that he suggests you know his character enough to know it was a trick, but on Faith's path you only interact with him at the first meeting.

My suggestion would be to have a few opportunities along the way to submit to Barry, but not in a sexual manner. Simply him asking/demanding you do a few things for him and you do them, for e.g. helping him move things, cooking him something. Maybe he buys an outfit for a 'girlfriend' and asks you to try it on because you have the same body-shape (the outfit could even be one he makes you wear after the island) or demands you clean his room where you stumble upon bondage equipment he left for you to find.

This way I feel the character would have been manipulated enough to a) go along on a trip with him, and b) actually secretly know what you're getting involved in. While I know us as player obviously know what the island is, your PC seems to jump the gun a bit IMO.

(It would also be cool but harder to implement if eventually faith was brought into the relationship as well as another pet.)

Cleaning his room (for cash or to repay a favor), find handcuffs or something similar and play with them, get stuck, Barry plays with you a bit and you can submit or not
Maybe movie not, but it ends up being a soft-core porn (slave pics from /newpics/b ?
- Halloween seeing him with another girl

ALSO: Me to renee98:  I’ll add a note for later to consider corrupting faith in some way with Barry or otherwise.

NetDenizen1147:
Well, different people view Incest in different ways. I personally like the idea of romantic incest, family love changing to romantic and sexual love, so the possibility of some kind of relationship forming between the player and their brother would appeal to me, especially if that relationship resulted in or was created as a result of a pregnancy. More outright choices to pursue sex with Dylan, sexting from the dorm room, etc.



UsagiTripleSix:
I feel like this (quickly getting porn-payoff) is one area where this “game” far excels over others.
Way too many games are really slow-burns, or just become endless teases (my own game being utterly
guilty of these), while this one has quick “payoff” without coming across as completely jarring.

Is it just me, though? I actually found the beginning section where you choose your options and
discover the side-effects to be the hottest part of the whole thing. :lol: It’s what got me invested
in the first place.

It does bring me to my main gripe, which is that I wish it was more obvious what the different
side-effects were doing, and that they were played up a bit more. I’m assuming many of them just
result in the player character automatically hooking up when there might’ve been an option,
otherwise, but I’d think something like having multiple levels of “super-easy-orgasm” would
have a dramatic impact on some sex events.

It’s been a really long time since I last played it, though, so I’m just going from memory.
...
This game introduced me to the X-change pill concept. At first, I thought the game was a
reference to the Japanese VN series of X-Change games. I love the concept, even if the
simplicity makes it harder to suspend disbelief.

As far as revisiting older parts of the game, goes… Since replayability seems like a strong
point (especially with trying out different side-effects), what I’d love to see is more
“width” added to the beginning. By that, I mean there are certain parts of the game that
have started to feel like a slog on repeat play-throughs (going home to see your family,
for instance). It’d be great to have more alternatives in the sections everyone has to go
through repeatedly.

Anyway, I'll be excited to check out the next update. :D

Add me to the "excited to see it's still being worked on" group. I love the branching
options and all the different endings.
Hopefully there are more fully Lesbian options in the update as well!

T7792:
Now for a suggestion.  So the ending I've found that I enjoyed the most is the 'Free Use' ending, and there are some minor edits that I think could improve it if you agree.  
When I play your game, I make some basic assumption about the world we are in.  I assume that in this reality, some things are true; 
1, Chastity is a much more mainstream fetish than RL due to how many people turn to that as a first option for being faithful and such.
2, X-change and similar have been around for some time and are very normal.
3, The rest of the world and the systems we use work similar to our own.

So with those 3 things being said, my suggestions for edits/additions for the free use ending are as follows,

1, Rename the collar/loop for free women to 'Halo', as they should be treated with dignity and respect (even if they are not treated like men)
2, Women in that country are classed as either FAB (female at birth) or FOX (female on x-change)
3, Have tourist compounds, obtaining a travel visa for the compounds should be quick and easy, though probably fairly expensive  (similar to places like Saudi Arabia, where there are tourist compounds where woman can where bikinis and people can drink booze.)  In these Freedonia compounds, men and women tourist can enjoy the free use girls.  The free uses girls there are either already in their first months of pregnancy or using birth control implants while assigned there.  Non-compound visa's are slow to get for most men.
4, Have the entry video say how once the free use girls were introduced, the crime rate fell to the lowest in the world and the only sexual crimes against FAB or FOX were from sexual sadists.  They were normally rapidly caught they were given choice between life in prison, castration or x-change (with mental conditioning).
5, Free use girls get 2 days per week that they do not have to be out, if they want to work extra days they can, (days off agreed with manager when starting the job) and 20 days of holiday per year.  The 2 days per week that they do not have to be out, if they are out they can be used.  When using the holiday days, they get a temp halo.  FOX's also get sick days and free medical care.
6, Men who are related to FOX's can get a full visa quicker and cheaper than men without a family FOX, though it is limited to 2 weeks every 2 years and only applies to family members not friends.
7, Mom may agree to visit after your brother's visit if you agree to use your holiday day when she is there, as she does not want to see to being used.
8, State in the training video that the economy is booming.
9, Have FOX's sign a 'free use' contract, stating what they get what is expected of them (including not leaving the country for more than their available holiday days).
10, FOX's can leave the country (using their holiday days) to any country with an extradition treaty with Freedonia.  In the treaties, they agree to deport any FOX that is in breach of their 'Free Use' contract.
11, While FOX's are allowed to leave the country using holiday days, you are not, as due to your criminal record you would not be granted a tourist visa (including the US as you renounce your citizenship when you arrived)
12, Any FAB can become a 'Free use girl' for a negotiated contract length. (though society probably judge them for it)
13, Older FOX's can become nannies for the single fathers.  They would live with the father and child and have a halo when out with the child/children, but only when with the child/children.
14, As in this society male children would be preferred female children (and unwanted male) can be cared for by 2 older FOX's living in a relationship together.  Again, Fox's would have a halo when out with the child/children, but only when with the child/children.
15, No one may encourage or train minors to join the 'free use' system.  Though, all 'free use' women should answer honesty (with a yes) when asked if they enjoy their job/life.
16, after birth a 'free use girl' should get a halo for 6 weeks or until a doctor okays her.  (Given that chastity belts are used a lot in this game, I was surprised to not see one here.)
17, After Brother gets home you get a surprise email from your father, saying that he has talked to your brother and his friend and come to understand that he may have overreacted when he disowned you, he informs you that he has booked a flight to come and see you, so you can talk it though, isn't that nice!....
