In Progress:
------------
  - Story mode
  - Dorms - If conflict then may end up either reconciling or having to switch rooms and ending up with a guy


Add, but not started yet
------------
  - Women's Studies professor
      -> upset at survey results, and seeing rumors she'd heard about the university were true
      -> complaining about university and the overt sexualization, prof with students, etc.
      -> gone next semester -> worried about her but find out she's been paid off

Continuing
----------
- Make sure there remains a Peter no-cuck path (MFF, but no MMF)
- Make sure there remains a gold-star lesbian path

Likely:
------------
  - (eg Faith + Anal Love results in 'technically still a virgin' scenes)
  - Roommate specific path: Hannah: ? Something prostitution related
  - Gold-star lesbian path (Samantha as mentor and then bar job, etc. Maybe also with art/model job)
  - I'm not sure. There might be a purple pill user as a side-character or a purple pill ending for the main character at some point.
============================
Maybe:
------------
  - More side effect or results from side effects
  - Have birth control pills cause side effect (orgasm denial, or increased libido) sometimes
  - Have denial side effect cause you to stop using condoms, withdrawl, or pill
  - More dominant content.  Player a dominatrix
  - It is possible for you to end the summer with you holding Dylan's chastity key I believe.  But he gives you your key back before you leave to return to school, I may change this in the future so that he keeps your key in some situations.
  - Ending with player as intersex
  - If I had a wishlist it would be for the Winter Break section to be expanded as it currently feels like it is the most repetetive with the least amount of choices
  - Add story option for veronica + porn star
  - More use of different photos for alternate body types
  - Future interactions with mentors.  One is in a rival sorority for example

============================

Probably Not:
------------
  - Could Dylan choose to become Diane permanently in the second half of the storyline if he became Diane and enjoyed it in the lesbian bar storyline?


============================
Future Endings:
- w/Peter and him in chastity
- w/veronica
- Jail for something

University Backstory
- X-Change donating to university and bribing officials to look the other way on issues, paying off people so they don't complain
- Engineering department developing sex toys
-

Other suggestions:
- A personal favourite would be a cheerleader to an athlete story for sure.
