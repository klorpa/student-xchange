TODO In Progress:
------------
  - Dorms - If conflict then may end up either reconciling or having to switch rooms and ending up with a guy
  - Women's Studies professor
  
TODO Add, but not started yet
------------
Peter - Hot Wife Ending
Peter - Chastity, but no cuckold ending

TODO Continuing
----------
- Make sure there remains a Peter no-cuck path (MFF, but no MMF)
- Make sure there remains a gold-star lesbian path
- Clean-ish path with Justin and Ministry

TODO Likely:
------------
  - (eg Faith + Anal Love results in 'technically still a virgin' scenes)
  - More dominant content.  Player a dominatrix  (Porn Star path or Call Girl Path)
  - Gold-star lesbian path (Samantha as mentor and then bar job, etc. Maybe also with art/model job)
============================
TODO Maybe:
------------
  - More side effect or results from side effects
  - Have birth control pills cause side effect (orgasm denial, or increased libido) sometimes
  - It is possible for you to end the summer with you holding Dylan's chastity key I believe.  But he gives you your key back before you leave to return to school, I may change this in the future so that he keeps your key in some situations.
  - Add story option for veronica + porn star
  - More use of different photos for alternate body types
  - Future interactions with mentors.  One is in a rival sorority for example
  - "Portal panty" simulation with electonic chasity belt. (Guys have sex toy remotely linked that stimulates your belt)
  - Dylan accidently becoming Diane permanently in other lesbian bar paths, similar to with Kate ending
  - Engineering? Design a womanizer-style sex toy that locks on to a piercing and can't be removed by you until unlocked by someone controlling it
============================
Postponed, maybe return to it after game is completed:
- Story mode (Postponed), maybe a replay mode that others can make instead

============================
TODO Future Endings:
- W/Veronica
- Ending with Jaylen

-------
University Backstory
- X-Change donating to university and bribing officials to look the other way on issues, paying off people so they don't complain
- Engineering department developing sex toys

-----------
Other suggestions:
- A personal favourite would be a cheerleader to an athlete story for sure.

AllOfThem:
One thing that I wouldn't mind seeing would be more refusal options during the side effects bonanza.

Specifically the easy/powerful orgasms side effects, which currently have no refusal options.

Now, I get it - why would anyone refuse such side effects? More pleasure for free!

But well, the player PoV can be somewhat different, and I feel like there are in-character reasons one might refuse (or be refused) those:
the player character is of the Faith variety and would rather not be led astray
the player doesn't get a choice - it's a medical test program, after all. Excessive orgasm effects could negatively affect results, therefore the program runners say 'No' in the player character's stead. Could be paired with a cash bonus. Choose the cash bonus before the side effects (simple checkbox on a preceding page, I imagine), lose your chance at many super orgasms... unless two side effect cancellers are already in effect. Positive side effects and the money, suck it, bitches
I thought about maybe also making it a parental choice, but implementation would probably be considerably more complicated, so eh.


renee98 :
TODO Barry path updates
I found the path where Barry 'forces' you on the island. Instantly one of my favourites. The only thing that has been bothering me about it as that he suggests you know his character enough to know it was a trick, but on Faith's path you only interact with him at the first meeting.

My suggestion would be to have a few opportunities along the way to submit to Barry, but not in a sexual manner. Simply him asking/demanding you do a few things for him and you do them, for e.g. helping him move things, cooking him something. Maybe he buys an outfit for a 'girlfriend' and asks you to try it on because you have the same body-shape (the outfit could even be one he makes you wear after the island) or demands you clean his room where you stumble upon bondage equipment he left for you to find.

This way I feel the character would have been manipulated enough to a) go along on a trip with him, and b) actually secretly know what you're getting involved in. While I know us as player obviously know what the island is, your PC seems to jump the gun a bit IMO.

(It would also be cool but harder to implement if eventually faith was brought into the relationship as well as another pet.)

TODO Cleaning his room (for cash or to repay a favor), find handcuffs or something similar and play with them, get stuck, Barry plays with you a bit and you can submit or not
TODO Maybe movie not, but it ends up being a soft-core porn (slave pics from /newpics/b ?
- Halloween seeing him with another girl

ALSO: Me to renee98:  I’ll add a note for later to consider corrupting faith in some way with Barry or otherwise.

NetDenizen1147:
Well, different people view Incest in different ways. I personally like the idea of romantic incest, family love changing to romantic and sexual love, so the possibility of some kind of relationship forming between the player and their brother would appeal to me, especially if that relationship resulted in or was created as a result of a pregnancy. More outright choices to pursue sex with Dylan, sexting from the dorm room, etc.



UsagiTripleSix:
I feel like this (quickly getting porn-payoff) is one area where this “game” far excels over others.
Way too many games are really slow-burns, or just become endless teases (my own game being utterly
guilty of these), while this one has quick “payoff” without coming across as completely jarring.

Is it just me, though? I actually found the beginning section where you choose your options and
discover the side-effects to be the hottest part of the whole thing. :lol: It’s what got me invested
in the first place.

It does bring me to my main gripe, which is that I wish it was more obvious what the different
side-effects were doing, and that they were played up a bit more. I’m assuming many of them just
result in the player character automatically hooking up when there might’ve been an option,
otherwise, but I’d think something like having multiple levels of “super-easy-orgasm” would
have a dramatic impact on some sex events.

It’s been a really long time since I last played it, though, so I’m just going from memory.
...
This game introduced me to the X-change pill concept. At first, I thought the game was a
reference to the Japanese VN series of X-Change games. I love the concept, even if the
simplicity makes it harder to suspend disbelief.

As far as revisiting older parts of the game, goes… Since replayability seems like a strong
point (especially with trying out different side-effects), what I’d love to see is more
“width” added to the beginning. By that, I mean there are certain parts of the game that
have started to feel like a slog on repeat play-throughs (going home to see your family,
for instance). It’d be great to have more alternatives in the sections everyone has to go
through repeatedly.

Anyway, I'll be excited to check out the next update. :D

Add me to the "excited to see it's still being worked on" group. I love the branching
options and all the different endings.
Hopefully there are more fully Lesbian options in the update as well!
