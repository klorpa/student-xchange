Changes made in Part 15.0.1
- Added additional text so new players have a better idea how your father will react if you tell him at the beginning
- Preference selection, when one can pick a name. As soon as one hits the 'r' key, the next page appears, rather than being able to write out the name. A hotkey getting priority where it shouldn't, I imagine.
- Removed non-existant generic "Prison" achievement from ending list - this was left over from before multiple prison endings were added.
- Eliminated bug treating Bailey like a boyfriend if you become permanently chaste.  Now leads to an alternate ending if you were dating Bailey.
