  As the end of the semester and finals approach, you aren't nearly as worried about passing as you were last semester.
  Your grades certainly aren't going to be all A's, but you are fairly confident you'll pass everything this semester.

  <<elseif $PlayerItemNerdKey>>
    With you holding the key to Peter's cock, he's always eager to help when you run into trouble, and that's certainly helped you pass too.
    You don't let Peter cum often, but at the end of the term, you decide he [[deserves a special reward|Part13Peter]]
  <<else>>
    There's still [[your job|Part13Job]] you need to focus on as well though.

  The forms are the same as the last time and you mostly fill them out now without even thinking much about the answers.

  <br>

  <<if $PlayerAbortion>>
    When you remember the abortion pills from your last visit, and the cramps you'd had, you go back
    and scratch out the zeros you wrote in the pregnancy boxes.
    <br/>
  <</if>>

  <<if $PlayerProtectionPerfect or $PlayerProtectionPermanent or $PlayerProtectionPill>>
    You happily fill out the "Date of Last Menstruation‚Äù.

      Thanks to your birth control,

      Thanks to your implant, 
    <</if>>
    you don't have to worry about those.
    <<if setup.areDating('Aaron') and $PlayerProtectionPill>>
      Though writing it down makes you think about spring break.  Your luggage had been in storage the whole week.  At
      the time you'd only thought about your clothes, but now that you are looking at the form.
    <</if>>
  <<else>>
    You don't really remember exactly when your last period was.  You've been so busy lately you haven't really kept track so you just put a
    question mark there.

      There's obviously no chance you are pregnant.

      <</if>>
    <<elseif $PregnancyCheck.count == 0>>
      You know you haven't had any chance to get pregnant since your last visit, and you weren't pregnant then, so obviously you aren't pregnant now.
    <<elseif $PlayerProtectionTry>>
      You think maybe you should get one of those app for your phone that helps you track when you are fertile, to maximize your chances.
    <<elseif $PlayerProtectionCondoms and setup.haveFucked('Blake')>>
      You remember the fun you and Veronica had with Blake and Darnell.  Ok, well, it was mostly your fun.  But obviously you and Veronica
      don't need condoms, so you hadn't even thought about it then.
    <<elseif $PlayerProtectionCondomsForgot>>
      You remember using condoms with Andrew before you'd moved in together.  Then you'd realized they'd gotten lost in the move and you hadn't
      been using anything for a while.
      <<if $PlayerProtectionNone>
        You just decided to let things happen after that.
      <<else>>
        You'd bought more after that and made a better effort to use them.  Well, most of the time.
      <</if>>
    <<elseif setup.areDating('Andrew') and $PlayerProtectionWithdraw>>
      You know you and Andrew haven't been as diligent and pulling out as you told yourself you'd be.  Sometimes he does, or you remind him too,
      but othertimes not.  You can't help it.  You just love looking up into his eyes as he cums inside you too much.
    <<elseif setup.areDating('Kate') or setup.isEx('Kate')>>
    <<elseif $PlayerProtectionCondoms>>
      You try to rememeber if you used condoms over spring break.  With all the drinking you did, you can't really be sure.

    The doctor comes in with the news.  He says it's difficult to determine exactly when you might have conceived since you couldn't remember when your last cycle was.
    Your implant also complicates the calculation as well.  He explains that they've seen some irregularities with development time in the early part of pregnancies.
    "Don't worry, it normalizes after a few months, and it doesn't pose any risk to the fetus at all."
