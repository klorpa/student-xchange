  When you get back, you find out your video sales have slipped even more over the summer.  Robert and you are doing what
  you can to improve things, but it isn't helping much.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Even letting fans at conventions film your private 'fan appreciation' visits, knowing many will post them to the internet,
  doesn't help.  It certainly helps sell tickets to the adult film conventions, but doesn't really impact your sales.

  Finally, you and Robert have a talk and decide that you don't want to keep taking time away from your studies to make videos

  There's no one yelling instructions or complaining because your hair is out of place.  And you just have to worry about

  And when he finishes, you are reminded of the other difference between this and porn.  When he cums, he doesn't pull out for a 'money shot' or
  leave his cock barely inside you for a 'creampie'.  He thrusts it deep inside and gives you every drop.  He doesn't have to worry
  about what looks good on camera, only what feels good.  And a few clenches around his cock after he cums helps make sure it feels amazing for him.

    Due to your pregnancy, they've replaced you in movie they are filming today.  But you stop by the set to say goodbye
    to everyone.  You are glad you did, or else you would have missed all of the excitement.
    <br><br>
    The new girl blows up over something minor and rants and raves at everyone on set for twenty minutes.  You try to stay
    away and watch from a distance.  Thankfully it's all on the behind the scenes video and one of your friends on the crew
    send you a copy to laugh at later.
    <br><br>
    Once she's stormed off the set and into a cab, the director gets back to trying to finish up the movie.  "Well, shit.
    We'll have to refilm that scene and then the next one, with a new girl.  But we can't get one on such short notice."
    He glances over at you and sighs, knowing he can't use you either.  Then he looks expectantly at one of his production
    assistants.
    <br><br>
    "Fine.", the assistant says.  Then he rummages through some equipment bags until eventually pulling out a botlle
    of X-Change Basic pills.  After he takes the pill, he quicky transforms into a beautiful young woman.  "Well, let's
    get started.  I want to get this over with."
    <br><br>
    "I knew I could count on you.", the director tells him.  You dobut the new girl will be working in porn again, but
    you are sure the production assistant's job is secure.
    <br><br>
    As Robert drives you [[back home|Part15Begin]], you both chuckle bit imagining the poor, reluctant production assistant
    and the double pentration scene he endured.  He clearly didn't enjoy those as much as you did.
  <<else>>
    You are filming one final scene today.  You thought you were good with your decision to 'retire' from porn, but it
    seems the stress of everything was getting to you more than you thought.
    <br><br>
    You blow up over something minor and start screaming at everyone.  Luckily your meltdown is after your last scene was
    filmed, but it takes Robert a while to calm you down.  Eventually he manages to talk you down from your tirade.  You
    both decide it's best to skip the after-party that's planned after everyone is done today.  You know they'll forgive
    you, but you doubt your coworkers want to see any more of you today.
    <br><br>
    After you are in his car and he's driving you [[back home|Part15Begin]], Robert tells you, "Normally, I'd punish you
    for your outburst today, but I know this has been stressful for you.  So, I'll overlook it.
    Though, you will be missing out on all the fun at the party, so I assume that's punishment.  There's more we need to
    discuss, but we can do that later after you've had some time to process everything."
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't find out about it today, obviously.  But you are amused to find out the behind-the-scenes video from
  today ends up being more popular than the film itself.
  <<if $PlayerPregnant and $PregnancySpring>>
    You doubt the studio minds.  Whether the sales and clicks are for a girl getting fucked in the ass or for one screaming
    at the camera, they get paid either way.

  <h1>Meeting with the Engineering department head</h1>
  <<set $sex.push({sex: 'male', name: 'Engineering Department Head'})>>
  You are summoned to a meeting with your boss, the head of the Engineering department.  "I've received noticed at the end of last semester that you
  were still on academic probation.  You still are, correct?", he asks you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Yes sir.", you say meekly.  "I promise you, I'll be working to resolve that as quickly as I can."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "That's all well and good.", he says.  "But unfortunately I can't let you continue in the program as long as you are on probation.  It's a univeristy
  requirement.  I was able to ignore it during the summer, but now that a new school year has started, I can't any longer."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You've been at this university, and in this department, long enough to know how things work.  "Sir, this program is a tremendous opportunity for me,
  and I really don't want to lose it.", you tell him as you walk behind his desk.  "I'm willing to do whatever it takes to stay in the program.",
  you say as you drop to your knees and begin to unbuckle his pants.
<</nobr>>

<video src="Part15/Engineer1.webm" autoplay loop muted height="500"></video>

<<nobr>>
  "I do have another option.", he says as you begin to suck his cock.  He waits to explain more until after you've made him come.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "That was wonderful.  Now the other option.", he continues finally.  "You're familiar with the project Kyle has been working on, right?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know about the computerized chastity belt Kyle was trying to perfect last year.  You'd really hoped to continue with your own projects, but
  if being Kyle's assistant or something for a month or two lets you stay in the program, it's worth it.  "Yes, sir.  He was making excellent
  progress on his belt I recall.", you answer.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "He has indeed.  We are hoping to to get it ready to market by the end of the school year.  And you can
  [[play a valuable part|Part15EngineerProbation2]] in that if you are interested.  And I can even get the dean to remove that horrible
  block they've placed on your orgasms.", he says.  You of course say that you are interested.

  <h1>Meeting with the Engineering department head</h1>
  <img src="Part15/Engineer2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400" align="left">
  "We have beta testers testing out the belt.  They won't be testing here though, but on their own time.  They'll be testing 24/7 to be precise.
  That's how the belt is intended to be used, obviously.  So that's how we need to test it."  You start to feel sorry for the poor girls, but
  then you remember the belt can also generate orgasms if it's programmed to, so you expect they'll have a better time than your past few months
  on probation.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Part of your job will be compiling the data from their weekly questionnaires and the readings their belts sent back and creating reports
  based on that."  It sounds boring, but you are betting the questionnaires might be amusing to read.  And it keeps you on the project.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "We'll also be needing your technical expertise to test the belt's security.  We think it's secure, be we need you to perform some pentration
  testing on it."  He chuckles at his little pun.  "Do you think you are up to that?", he asks.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Yes sir.", you quickly answer.  You pause to lick up a bit of cum you feel down your face, getting the last bit with your finger before licking it clean.
  "That sounds very interesting, especially the security testing.  I'm definitely up for the challenge."  You want to make sure he doesn't forget about the
  other part he'd mentioned.  "And you'll be able to talk to the dean about my denial once I start?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Of course.  I've already cleared it with him.", he says.  You realize he'd planned to allow you this other option long before you'd sucked his cock.
  He certainly wasn't going to stop you to tell you that though.  "I'll send an email over when you leave today.  You can head right over to the X-Change
  office to get that denial setting removed as soon as [[your fitting is done|Part15EngineerProbation3]]."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "My... fitting...", is all you can say in response.

    Of course, I have the key for your old manual belt.  I'll send that back to <<if $Keyholder>>$Keyholder<<else>>your keyholder<</if>> for you.

  specifications, source code, and schematics.", he says clearly excited.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if setup.areDating('Kate') or setup.areDating('Veronica')>>
    You hope $dating[0] won't mind you agreeing to this without discussing it with her first, but you don't really have time.  And you really want to
    stay in the program.  You doubt that she'll be too upset that all the orgasms are hers until you are done with the testing.
  <<elseif $dating.length > 0>>
    You hope $dating[0] won't mind you agreeing to this without discussing it with him first, but you don't really have time.  And you really want to
    stay in the engineering program.  Hopefully you can still keep him happy with your mouth and ass until you are done with the testing.
  <</if>>
  You sigh with resignation as he begins measuring you in the lab.  
  <<if !$PlayerPregnant and $PlayerProtectionTry>>
    You suppose you'll just have to wait until your testing is done before you can try to get
    <<if $PlayerMother or $PlayerAbortion or $PlayerAdoption>>pregnant again.<<else>>pregnant.<</if>>
  <</if>>
  "The fit will adjust as you sleep
  <<if $PlayerPregnant>>
    though your pregnancy may test the limits of that feature.  Let me know if you have any issues and I'll make manual adjustments.", he tells you.
    "And let me know when you have any doctor appointments so we can make arrangements for that."
  <<else>>
    to adjust for any weight gain or loss.  But let me know if you have any issues and I'll make manual adjustments.", he tells you.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your heart stops for a second as he clicks the belt closed around your waist.  "Now, for your testing parameters.  You have two objectives.
  Both are their own reward, but will also come with a bonus payment as well:
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Your first goal is to have an unauthorized orgasm.  That means an orgasm that the registered 'owner' of the belt, me in this case,
  has not specifically authorized.  And I won't be authorizing any, so if you orgasm, then you've succeeded.  You just get one payment for each
  method you might discover, but feel free to enjoy the orgasms until we fix the flaw you've uncovered.  Once we believe it's been corrected,
  you'll be eligible for another payment if you can still orgasm that way, or find another flaw.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "You can use whatever means necessary with the belt still on for your orgasm.  Whether that's utilizing the parts of your body that aren't locked away,
  sneaking anything around or through the belt, vibrations, hacking the programming, whatever you want to try.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Your other goal, is to remove the belt entirely.  If you are able to remove the belt, then you've succeeded.  You can use any mechnical, electronic,
  really any means you want to accomplish this.  I'd be very careful trying to do anything destructive though.  As you know, this isn't simple steel here,
  and I don't want you to injury yourself.  We are fairly confident you won't succeed on this goal, but we'd rather no know than after we get to market if
  there's a flaw.  If you manage to escape, then you'll get an substantial bonus payable after you help us fix the flaw and you resume your testing." 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are excited when you see what looks like a very pickable lock on the front cover.
  <<if $PlayerProtectionPill or $PlayerProtectionPerfect or $PlayerProtectionPermanent or $PlayerPregnant>>
    He sees you looking it at it and says, "You may be able to pick the hygiene shield lock.
  <<else>>
    But then he just hands you the key to it.  "You'll probably need to remove the hygiene shield once a month or so.
  <</if>>
  But you should read about the countermeasures in the specifications before you try to orgasm that way, or leave the hygiene shield off for too long."

    $dating is upset at first when you tell him about the belt.  But he starts to be more understanding when you explain how much you want to
    remain in the engineering program.  Or maybe his mood changed when you dropped to your knees and pulled out his cock.  Either way, he
    stopped complaining about the belt, at least for now.

    It doesn't take you long to find guys willing to help you try to orgasm with your belt still on.  Well, they are trying to orgasm with your

  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Now that the dean's denial has been lifted, you were too eager to try to orgasm, so you hadn't bothered to check all of the settings your boss had given
  your belt.  You quickly discover one of them as you start on <<if $dating.length>>$dating<<else>>the first guy<</if>>'s cock.  You think you feel
  something as soon as his cock hits your tongue, but after you work it a while, there's no doubting the belt is stimulating you while you suck his cock.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>
    As if you needed any more encouragement to suck cock.

    You only planned on sucking him for a little while, then having him fuck your ass.  But now you don't want to stop.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral > 2>>
    You loved giving blowjobs before, the warm pleasure that spread through your body anytime you had a cock in your mouth.  But with the added

    are about to beat the belt already.
    <br><br>
    The vibrations quickly slow and then stop altogether, but you are already so close.  You enthusiastically keep working his cock, focusing on how
    good it feels in your mouth, and imagining that wonderful feeling when his cum hit your tongue.
    <br><br>
    But just when you think your orgasm is a moment away, you feel a shock, right against your clit.  The pain is just for an instant, and then it's gone.
    But it's enough to drive your orgasm back.  A few moments later, you are reveling in the taste of his cum, but there's no orgasm for you like you'd
    hoped.
    <br><br>
    You don't care about the shock, it wasn't that bad, and it felt so good before then.  You can't wait to you can give your next blowob.  You hope
    now that you are expecting the shock, it won't surprise you and prevent your orgasm like this time.  It'll take several more blowobs before you
    accept how naive that hope was.
  <<else>>
    You <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>loved<<else>>enjoyed<</if>> giving blowjobs before, but you soon discover you are going to
    <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>love it even more<<else>>absolutely love it<</if>> now.
    You eagerly suck his cock, hoping he doesn't cum before you do.  You know if he lasts long enough, the vibrations the belt is giving you will make
    you cum.  But as you start to get close to your orgasm, you feel the vibratons start to fade until they are just a soft, pleasant buzz.  A bit later
    they pick up again, keeping you tantalizingly close to an orgasm, but never letting you cum.
    <br><br>
    Your hand instinctively reaches between your legs and hits hard steel, or rather titanium-carbon-fiber-whatever, you don't really care right now.
    You keep sucking his cock because you don't want the pleasure to stop.  It isn't much longer and he his filling your mouth with cum.  You
    suck a bit longer as the ramps the vibrations up to high again, but just long enough to leave you right on the edge before stopping.
    <br><br>
    You keep trying later with more blowjobs, hoping the belt will make a mistake and go to far one of the times, or see if playing with your
    breasts, or anything else, will give you the bit extra you need, but it's still not enough.
  <</if>>
  But sucking cock [[isn't the only option|Part15EngineerProbation5]] the belt has given you.

    and eager to give your second plan a try.

    You don't think the guys you find much care if you can manage to get off from it or not.  But they are perfectly happy fucking your ass.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You think the belt is stimulating you again, but if it is, it's more subtle than before.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectAnal>>
    Then again, maybe it isn't stimuating you at all.  You've always loved anal and maybe that's all it is.
  <</if>>
  Either way you love the feeling of fullness his cock gives you.  But it also leaves you aching even more to feel his cock filling you
  the one place he can't.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As he gets less nervous about your belt and more eager about fucking your ass, your pleasure builds too.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectAnal > 2>>
    You've came from anal before, and you are hoping you can now.   You are sure you are going to be able to but at the last moment
    <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral > 2>>
      you are shocked again.  "Not this too!", you think to yourself.
    <<else>>
      you feel a shock, right against your clit.  The pain is just for an instant, and then it's gone.
      But it's enough to drive your orgasm back.  A few moments later, you feel his cum fill your ass, but there's no orgasm for you like you'd
      hoped.
      <br><br>
      You don't care about the shock, it wasn't that bad, and it felt so good before then.  You can't wait to he can fuck your ass again.
      You hope now that you are expecting the shock, it won't surprise you and prevent your orgasm like this time.  It'll take several more
      times before you accept how naive that hope was.
    <</if>>
  <<else>>
    By the time his cum fills your ass you are on the verge of an orgasm, but he seemed to cum just a moment too soon.  It felt so good though,
    you want to try again hoping he can last a little longer the second time.
    <br><br>
    He does last longer, but you are left right on the edge again, aching for just that little bit more that would let you cum.  You realize the
    belt must be softly stimulating you, just enought to slowly push you right to the edge, but never pushing you the rest of the way.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You accept now that you aren't going to be able to cum this easily, but you also love how good it feels just to try.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral > 2 or $PlayerSideEffectAnal > 2>>It's even worth the shocks you know you'll get.<</if>>
  As good as it feels though, you are always left with a desperate need for more when he's done.

  You realize you are going to have to get more creative if you want to have any chance to defeat this belt.  You decide to dig into the documents

  She understands that there wasn't time, and knows how much you want to stay in the engineering program, so she isn't upset with you.
  But you still feel bad for not discussing it with her first before you agreed to this belt.  But you are more than capable of showing her
  the two of you can still have fun, even with you in this belt.  You figure you and her can try to figure out a way around your belt later.
<</nobr>>

  <video src="Part15/Engineer6.webm" autoplay loop muted height="550"></video>

<<nobr>>
  You were eager to be with $dating[0], and you hadn't bothered to check all of the settings your boss had given your belt.  You quickly discover
  one of them.  You think you feel something as soon as your tongue first tastes her, but after you continue for a while and she gets more and
  more wet from your attention, there's no doubting the belt is stimulating you while you pleasure her.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>
    As if you needed any more encouragement to eat her out.
  <<else>>
    You might have switched to your fingers after a while, but now you don't want to stop.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You hope as you keep going the pleasure will keep building, but as you start to get close the vibrations lessen until you can barely feel them.
  They pick back up after a while.  The cycle repeats as the belt keeps you agonizingly close to an orgasm you know it won't give you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  $dating[0]'s orgasm isn't going to be denied though.  She holds your head against her as she screams out with an orgasm.  You throb as you
  ache for one too.  But you feel the pleasure fade away as the belt stops stimulating you after your tongue leaves $dating[0].
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You try several more things, but the belt seems to only stimulate you when your tongue is on or inside $dating[0].  She doesn't mind though
  and lets you experiment with trying to orgasm from eating her out as much as you want.  Eventually she tries some of her toys on you.  The dildo
  is your ass feels nice, but isn't going to get you off.  Fucking her with a strap-on is fun as always, but you don't get those teasing vibrations.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You quickly discover not to try to generate your own vibrations.  She tries her magic wand against your belt.  You can feel the vibrations, but
  they are damped by the belt.  Even so, if she kept it up long enough you might be able to cum.  But the belt ensures that won't happen.  After a few
  seconds with the vibrator you feel a painful shock hit your clit.  Another one hits a second or two later.  They stop once she pulls the vibrator
  away.  "Well, I guess we won't be trying that then.", she says.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You accept now that you aren't going to be able to cum easily in this, but you still love how you feel when you eat $dating[0] out, so you
  do that as often as she wants.  As good as it feels though, you are always left with a desperate need for more when you're done.

<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You've been dreading this meeting.  You knew the denial effect from the dean's punishment would be a problem for the testing they do on you.  You'd
  hoped to be off of academic probation before it was time to return, but just hoping for it didn't make it happen.  Now you have to go meet with someone
  about it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know what the meeting is about your probation but you don't know what they are going to say.  Are you getting fired?  Are they going to have you
  cleaning up the mess you and the other subjects always leave in the testing rooms until you get off probation? Have they worked something out with
  the dean.  You really hope it's that last one.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't whether to show up looking sexy and willing to do anything the supervisor wants to keep your job, or whether to try to look like a good
  student who is working on improving her grades.  After struggling with it a bit, you try to find a middle ground and then head to your meeting.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you get there you meeting with the department head.  "We are meetng with all of the test subjects from your cohort, but given your special
  circumstances, I thought it best to meet with you individually.", he starts.  "You won't be participating in the same sort of testing you were
  last year.  A new batch of incomming freshmen will be starting in your place."  You wonder if he is firing all of you then?  But then he continues,
  "But we have another opportunity for you all.  And in your case the offer also includes having the dean lift your orgasm block."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "We are in the beta testing phase of an exciting product we hope to be placing on the market soon.", you were already sold on participating
  as soon as you heard that you'd get your orgasms back.  Then he starts to explain the product, "It is a computerized
  chastity belt."  Great. So you'll be trading one form of denial for another one, you think.  "I can see your disappointment, but it's not
  as simple as that.  This belt doesn't just deny your pleasure, it can also give you pleasure.  It all depends on the settings used, and we will
  be using a variety of them during the beta testing.  I can guarantee you'll have more orgasms help us with this than you would staying on the
  dean's denial list."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You'll get to keep your job, <b>and</b> orgasm again.  Of course you agree to participate in the beta testing.
  <<if $dating.length>>
    You hope $dating[0] isn't angry with you for agreeing without discussing it first.
  <</if>>
  "Great, let's head over to the lab right now [[for your fitting|Part15TestSubjectBetaTest]] then.", he says.

	<h1>Meeting in the Engineering department</h1>
  <img src="Part15/TestSubject2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400" align="left">
  You are bit early and have a chance to talk to some of the other girls that started as test subjects last year, just like you.  You recognize some
  of them from the X-Change orientation and other events as well.  Some of the others you don't.  But that makes sense, since they've been testing
  women both born that way, and recently transformed thanks X-Change.  But none of you know what the meeting is supposed to be about, only that
  it was mandatory that you attend.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The four of you go into the meeting and wait.  By the time the department head comes up to the front of the room, nearly all the other test subjects
  that joined at the same time you did are there.  "Welcome back, ladies.", he begins.  "I have some bad news for you and some good news.  I'll start
  with the bad.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The testing program you were working on last year, won't be needing any of you this year.  I want to thank you all for your participation.
  You have helped a great deal in helping us evaluate and perfect our potential products.  You've also helped advance science, we now have much
  more data on the female orgasm and how it varies from woman to woman as well whether or to what degree X-Change transformation affect them...
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "However, we have gathered all of the data we need from all of you.  We are now very familiar with the nature, quality, and many other details
  of your orgasms, and many other details.  For any of you that would like a personal report of your own data, let one of the research
  assistants know and they will send it to you.  But don't worry, even though your participation is ending, the experiments, but with a new cohort
  of test subjects starting soon.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The good news for all of you though, is that while your participation as test subects has ended, we have another exciting opportunity for you.
  We have a new product that we hope to be bringing to market soon, and we'd like all of you to test it.  The pay will be the same as you were
  receiving as a test subject, and you will only rarely need to visit the lab here.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Now, I'm sure you're wondering what the product is.  It is a computerizd chastity belt.", but before any of you get up leave let me explain
  a few of it's features.  This belt doesn't just deny your pleasure, it can also give you pleasure.  It all depends on the settings used, and we will
  be using a variety of them during the beta testing.  I can guarantee you will have an amazing orgasm today if you agree, and many more during
  your testing.  If you'd like to know more about what to expect, you can read through the 'Wearer's Manual' we will provide if you participate.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I know at least one of you is pregnant, so I will disclosure one feature now.  The belt's fit auto-adjusts as you sleep, so it will expand
  with you as you progress.  If you have any issues let us know and we will address them.  And of course we will coordinate with any doctor
  visits you have.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "For those wishing to sign up, you'll need to do so before you leave today.  Your testing will begin as soon as you leave the lab today.
  During your fitting you will need to sign the "Beta-tester Non-disclosure Agreement" we will provide.  On your way out we will provide a
  secure link to the documentation.  Sorry we can't just hand you a booklet right now, but this is still a pre-market product and we don't want

    After you discretely ask about the chastity belt you are already wearing he tells you, "We are especially interested in hearing from

  First they have you sign the non-disclosure agreement he mentioned.
  <<if $PlayerChastityBelt>>
    Then, before removing your current chastity belt, they restrain you.  "Sorry this is necessary.", he tells you.  "But it was the one condition
    <<if $Keyholder>>$Keyholder<<else>>your keyholder<</if>> had.  I suppose so you don't go running out the door half-naked as soon as you are
    unlocked. I know you would never do that though.  But still, a promise is a promise."
    <br><br>
    Your heart stops for a second as he clicks the belt closed around your waist.  Once you hear the click of your new belt locking closed,
    your restraints are removed.
  <<else>>
    Then he has you strip below the waist and measures you.  Then he selects a belt from the table nearby and positions it in place on you.

  <<if $PlayerProtectionPill or $PlayerProtectionPerfect or $PlayerProtectionPermanent or $PlayerPregnant>>
    You shouldn't have any hygiene issues, but if you do, let us know."
  <<else>>
    Oh, and here's the key to the hygiene shield in the front there, try not to lose it.  You'll probably need to remove the hygiene shield
    occasionally when you're menstrating.  But don't leave it off too long, or try to use it for anything other than its intended purpose, or
    you'll regret it.  You can read in the manual about the countermeasures if you are curious."

  He's clearly expecting you to leave at that point.  "Ummm... he... the department head, said we'd get an orgasm.", you ask meekly as
  instinctively you already realize you are at their mercy.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Not right now.  We have quite a few girls to get fitted, and that would take forever.  But it is set to give you one sometime today.", he tells you
  quickly, eager to get on to the next fitting.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "But if you don't feel like being patient, the 'Oral Encouragement' feature should speed it along.
  You can look over the manual when they send the link out, but I'm guessing you don't want to wait for that either.  I'm sure you can
  [[find a friend and figure it out|Part15TestSubjectBetaTest2]] on your own before then."

    After a quick visit to the X-Change office to get the probation denial setting removed, you head back over to the student center.
  <</if>>
  It doesn't take you long to find a guy willing to help you try to trigger the orgasm you were promised.  Well, he probably doesn't care if that
  hppens or not, but he is certainly willing to let you suck his cock if that's what it takes.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It also doesn't take you long to figure out what the 'Oral Encouragement' feature does.  Just a few seconds after his cock is in your mouth,
  you can feel the vibrations start.  Gently at first, but picking up in intensity as the intensity of your blowjob increases.
  You <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>loved<<else>>enjoyed<</if>> giving blowjobs before, but if this setting stays on, you are going to
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>love it even more<<else>>absolutely love it<</if>> now.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know if he lasts long enough, you'll cum.  Your only worry is that he'll cum too soon, and the belt will stop.  But you don't want
  to slow down, and you only take his cock out of your mouth long enough to occasionally catch your breath.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But as you start to get close to your orgasm, you feel the vibratons start to fade until they are just a soft, pleasant buzz.  A bit later
  they pick up again, keeping you tantalizingly close to an orgasm, but never letting you cum.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are desperate for an orgasm by the time he cums.  You keep sucking a bit longer as the cums, hoping for just a bit more to put you over
  the edge.  But then the belt kicks into high gear or something and you get quite a bit more.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  His cum oozes down your face as you scream out before you can even swallow his cum.  The vibrations continue as you hold onto him for support as
  your body shakes with a powerful orgasm.  The vibrations continue a while longer.  Just when you think you can't take it anymore, they slowly
  die down.  You lie down next to him with a messy smile on your face.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As soon as he is ready, you go again.  The vibrations continue as before, keeping you on the edge as you suck his cock.  But it doesn't give
  you the orgam at the end.  He leaves happy and drained, but you are still horny when he gone.  You try a few more times with a different guy, but
  you can't get another orgasm from it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You decide to give up for today and wait until the [["Wearer's Guide" email arrives|Part15TestSubjectBetaTest3]] to see how to trigger an orgasm again.

<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  The email finally arrives, and there's a number of featues you'll read up on later, but the "Oral Encouragement" feature is the one your status page
  says is active right now, and that's the one you wanted to focus on anyway.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote style="width: 35%;">
    The <b><i>Owner</i></b> may set an initial daily oral target for the <b><i>Wearer</i></b> when activating the Oral Encouragement feature.
    If no target is set, it will default to 1.  <b><i>Wearer</i></b> will receive encouraging stimulation throughout their oral service each time.
    Once the <b><i>Wearer</i></b> reaches her daily target, she will be rewarded with an orgasm (assuming no other feature is prohibiting this).
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Well, that's why it triggered an orgasm.  You keep reading.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote style="width: 35%;">
    The <b><i>Owner</i></b> may keep the daily target constant, increase it at constant or geometic rate, or leave it at the default "Personal Best"
    setting.  With the Personal Best setting the <b><i>Wearer</i></b>'s daily target will always be one more than her previous daily best.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Ok, well why didn't I get a second, third, and fourth orgasm then, you wonder.  As far as this thing knows those each exceeded my personal
  best too.  You keep reading to see if it explains that.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    Once the <b><i>Wearer</i></b> reaches her daily target, she will not receive any further orgasm rewards that day from Oral Encouragement feature.
    She will still receive encouraging stimulation for any oral service above and beyond her target and orgasms related to any other enabled features
    are still possible.
    <br><br>
    If the daily target is exceeded, then the actual number achieved that day, not the previous goal, will be used to calculate the next day's goal.
    This also applies if the goal was otherwise set to be fixed.  This will ensure that even if an initial goal is set too low, she will soon reach a
    level that she finds challenging thus encouraging constant improvement.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Wait, does that mean... You reread the passages serveral times.  You realize it's saying that you would have only had to give two blowjobs tomorrow
  for an orgasm.  But since you already gave four of them today, you'll have to give five tomorrow! Then six the next day, and... You wonder how long
  many orgasms you'll actually be able to get from this feature before you'll have to be spending all your free time sucking cock just for one orgasm.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Well, you figure it could have been worse.  You'd almost went out to find a third guy to try with.  At least stopping when you did gave you a few
  extra days before the targets get out of hand.

<<nobr>>
  You don't see any other active features on your status page, just the one guaranteed orgasm he promised you today, but it's marked as complete.
  You do see it is set to count a new day as starting at 6 AM.  That's good, having it reset at midnight would have been annoying.  You go ahead and
  follow the instructions to download the app for your phone before [[going to sleep|Part15TestSubjectBetaTest4]].
<</nobr>>

  <<set $DailyBJMinimum to 1>>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You are awoken the next morning at 6 AM to your belt stimulating you again.  You feel yourself getting close to an orgasm, but at the
  last minute the vibrations stop abruptly.  You are left wide awake now and wanting more.  Your phone beeps with a notification. "Congratulations
  on exceeding your oral target of 1 yesterday.  Your target for today is 5."  And there is also another silent notification you had received before
  you woke up.  "Belt Configuration Change Received From Owner."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you check the app, it says that "Morning Wakeup" was enabled, and that it's set to wake you with an edge if you'd met your target, with
  'gentle teasing' if you did not.  You also see a "Minimum target" setting, but it says "0".  As you are looking at the settings on the page, you
  accidently hit the "+" next to the "0" and it instantly changes to a "1".  Below that it now says "if minimum daily target is not achived, punishment
  shocks will be used for Morning Wakeup routine.  You frantically try to hit the "-" to switch it back to zero, but it ignores you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Does that mean I have to suck a cock every day if I don't want to be punished now, you wonder.  You open up the manual again to see how to disable
  that. You don't see anything in the "Oral Encouragement" section but you do find a relevant passage elsewhere.  But it's not what you wanted to see.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    By default, if the <b><i>Wearer</i></b> desires to challenge herself, most settings will allow a manual increase in difficulty.  However any decrease
    in difficulty can only be authorized by the <b><i>Owner</i></b>.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't expect the chances of them doing that for you to be very high.  You go back to the app again, this time being extremely careful not to
  accidentally click anything.  You try to see what the other settings that changed were, but all you can see enabled are "Oral Encouragement" and
  "Morning Wakeup".  You do see a small indicator in the corner of the screen. When you check the manual it says it indicates that there are enabled
  settings or features hidden from the wearer.  You suppose you'll just have to wait and see what those might be.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You've been looking through the app and manual for a while when another notification pops up, a regular one from your calendar this time.  It's
  reminding you of the your meeting in an hour at the campus X-Change office [[about their new 'Buddy' program|Part15Buddy]].
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You quickly head to the shower.  An hour is plenty of time to get ready and get over there.  But you are hoping to be able to have some extra
  time to find someone to help you get that minimum daily target you set for yourself out of the way.  The rest of your goal for
  today will have to wait until after the meeting.

  "Oh, thank you Daddy!", you say as you crawl across the bed.  Then you unbuckle Aaron's pants and begin to suck his cock.  You look up at him and
  smile in gratitude for taking that stress from your mind.

  The next morning Daddy wakes you with a kiss, then reminds you of the meeting you have soon.  "Oh right.", you say still sleepy.

  Since you aren't about to be locked into some experimental chastity belt for... you realize they never even said how long it would be.  Anyway,
  you'll need to find a new job.  The department has helpfully provided a list of a few jobs they knew had openings, so they could provide them to

  The department head said he could write you a discrete reference describing your job as a 'lab assistant' if you were interested in one of the

  a different coffee shop, one where the [[baristas wear bikinis|Part15TestSubjectJobChangeBikiniBarista]] instead of aprons.  The fact that he said
  he'd be more specific about your work in recommending you to these employers lets you know something of what your job might be like at those places.

    Of course, you could always just switch from [[seeing clients as a call girl|Part15TestSubjectJobChangeCallGirl]] every now and then, to making

  Your new job is quite the change.  Before you were stapped down to a machine the whole time completely helpless,
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectSubmissive>>
    you miss that part,
  <</if>>
  now you spend your day wandering the aisles reshelving books or working behind the counter checking people out.  Before you heard
  the constant, loud buzz of the machine you were on.  But now it's always so quiet, and you are supposed to shush anyone speaking too loud.

  Working a full shift is certainly more hours than you'd spend at your visits to the lab, but you have much more energy we you go home afterwards.

  But they've figured out that not ever challenge a newly converted woman will face will be something her natural-born mentor will have any experience

  her goals, but you also know from experience she must at some level wanted to be a woman.  Maybe permanently, maybe just for a while, but you

  marked 'no' on the birth control stuff."  When you press her on what she means it didn't apply, she explains.  "I'm not planning on starting
  a relationship right now, I want to focus on school.  And even if I were, I'm not going to going to be having sex with guys. I'm not gay. Not
  that there's anything with being gay.  I'm just not.  And birth control pills have side effects sometimes. Not the X-Change kind, just the
  normal medicine kind I mean.  I don't want to take them if there's no need to."
