  When you get back, you find out your video sales have slipped even more over the summer.  Robert and you are doing what
  you can to improve things, but it isn't helping much.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Even letting fans at conventions film your private 'fan appreciation' visits, knowing many will post them to the internet,
  doesn't help.  It certainly helps sell tickets to the adult film conventions, but doesn't really impact your sales.

  Finally, you and Robert have a talk and decide that you don't want to keep taking time away from your studies to make videos

        if you want to pick up some extra money. It's easier than being a porn star.  You still get to make money from having

  And when he finishes, you are reminded of the other difference between this and porn.  When he cums, he doesn't pull out for a 'money shot' or
  leave his cock barely inside you for a 'creampie'.  He thrusts it deep inside and gives you every drop.  He doesn't have to worry
  about what looks good on camera, only what feels good.  And a few clenches around his cock after he cums helps make sure it feels amazing for him.

    Due to your pregnancy, they've replaced you in movie they are filming today.  But you stop by the set to say goodbye
    to everyone.  You are glad you did, or else you would have missed all of the excitement.
    <br><br>
    The new girl blows up over something minor and rants and raves at everyone on set for twenty minutes.  You try to stay
    away and watch from a distance.  Thankfully it's all on the behind the scenes video and one of your friends on the crew
    send you a copy to laugh at later.
    <br><br>
    Once she's stormed off the set and into a cab, the director gets back to trying to finish up the movie.  "Well, shit.
    We'll have to refilm that scene and then the next one, with a new girl.  But we can't get one on such short notice."
    He glances over at you and sighs, knowing he can't use you either.  Then he looks expectantly at one of his production
    assistants.
    <br><br>
    "Fine," the assistant says.  Then he rummages through some equipment bags until eventually pulling out a botlle
    of X-Change Basic pills.  After he takes the pill, he quicky transforms into a beautiful young woman.  "Well, let's
    get started.  I want to get this over with."
    <br><br>
    "I knew I could count on you," the director tells him.  You dobut the new girl will be working in porn again, but
    you are sure the production assistant's job is secure.
    <br><br>
    As Robert drives you [[back home|Part15Begin]], you both chuckle bit imagining the poor, reluctant production assistant
    and the double pentration scene he endured.  He clearly didn't enjoy those as much as you did.
  <<else>>
    You are filming one final scene today.  You thought you were good with your decision to 'retire' from porn, but it
    seems the stress of everything was getting to you more than you thought.
    <br><br>
    You blow up over something minor and start screaming at everyone.  Luckily your meltdown is after your last scene was
    filmed, but it takes Robert a while to calm you down.  Eventually he manages to talk you down from your tirade.  You
    both decide it's best to skip the after-party that's planned after everyone is done today.  You know they'll forgive
    you, but you doubt your coworkers want to see any more of you today.
    <br><br>
    After you are in his car and he's driving you [[back home|Part15Begin]], Robert tells you, "Normally, I'd punish you
    for your outburst today, but I know this has been stressful for you.  So, I'll overlook it.
    Though, you will be missing out on all the fun at the party, so I assume that's punishment.  There's more we need to
    discuss, but we can do that later after you've had some time to process everything."
  <</if>>

  You don't find out about it today, obviously.  But you are amused to find out the behind-the-scenes video from
  today ends up being more popular than the film itself.
  <<if $PlayerPregnant and $PregnancySpring>>
    You doubt the studio minds.  Whether the sales and clicks are for a girl getting fucked in the ass or for one screaming
    at the camera, they get paid either way.

Penetration testing attempt #1
- Hacking the traffic between the app and the server
  - succeeds in getting the app to think you are the wearer
  - You can click "Unlock", "Orgasm", or change one of the settings(?)
    - If click "Orgasm", then get one, immediately
      - Boss emails you the next day. He's happy you found the flaw.  The traffic really should be encrypted.  That should be an easy fix too.
      - They take the server down, disabling the app but not the belts, until they fix it.
      - Payment is sent to you for being able to orgasm.
    - If click "Unlock", it asks you to confirm which you do, then it asks for an unlock code.
      - It triggers an "Unauthorized access" warning and activates punishment mode until it is disabled by owner
        - Have to confess to boss about how you tried to access.
          - He's happy you found the flaw.  The traffic really should be encrypted.  That should be an easy fix too.
          - Didn't manage to get unlocked or orgasm, so no payment.  He does switch the punishment over to something more plesant as a reward,
          - Random teasing / edging at any time of day or night in public or not.  For several days until the bug is fixed

    As you stumble out of the their frat house, feeling the dried cum on your skin and in your hair, you decided you should at least go talk to the

    But there's so many things on campus that seemed designed to make you think about sex.  But even when you aren't confronted with any of that, your

    Even just walking passed a few frat guys, and your mind is fantasizing about having sex with all of them.  All of them at once!  You decide that

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Yes, very much so," you confirm.
  <<if $CampusMinistryFailSummer>>
    "I feel like I'm completely out of control, and it started when the dean had them activate that academic probation denial thing.

  The doctor said you had something that maybe could help me.  Like a pill or a shot or something?  Or some support program?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "No, it's nothing like that.  It's actually something you wear.  I'm not sure if you are familiar with the term, but it's called a 'Chastity Belt',
  and it will ensure that you can never succumb to your desires in a moment of weakness like you
  <<if $CampusMinistryFailSummer>>
    complain you have been doing.
  <<else>>
    are worried you might.
  <</if>>
  And if you have heard of chastity belts before, I can assure you that this one is far more advanced than anything on the market now.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The belt you'd be testing is actually a computerizd chastity belt.  With a traditional belt, most would only prevent vaginal intercourse.  There
  are ones that also prevent anal sex, but those present obvious daily hygiene issues.  And no traditional belt would prevent you from engaging in oral sex.
  Ours can. Or at least it can strongly discourage them both.
  <<if setup.areDating('Andrew')>>
    But we can set it to allow either or both when you are at your boyfriend's apartment, 
    <<if !setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
      should you wish to become sexually active with him,
    <</if>>
    ensuring your monogamy.
  <</if>>
  It is also capable of providing you pleasure if so configured.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Women like you, that wish to
  <<if $CampusMinistryFailSummer>>
    return to a chaste lifestyle,
  <<else>>
    remain chaste or to maintain a monogamous relationship,

  <<else>>
    <<if setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
      You wish you could talk it over with Andrew first.  But then again, that would mean confessing to him the thoughts you'd had about having sex with
      other men.  So maybe it's better you are making this decision on your own.
      <br><br>

    You think it over, and then tell him either "[[Yes, I'd love to participate|Part15MinistryTester3]]," or

    Oh, and here's the key to the hygiene shield in the front there, try not to lose it.  You'll probably need to remove the hygiene shield

    But that's just during testing, so he can't unlock you or alter anything that would affect the testing parameters.  Don't worry, as soon as

    "Oh, and if you enter in a monogamous relationship and wish to enable certain features for your boy or girlfriend, please let us know

	<h1>Waiting for Andrew</h1>
  You thought he'd just be in and out, but Andrew's meeting at the Engineering department seems to be taking forever.  They wouldn't let you join him, so you
  are doing your best to be patient as you wait on the bench outside their building.  You remind yourself to thank him for taking so much time out of his
  day to do this for you.  After all, this was your decision to test this belt out, not his.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
<img src="Part15/Ministry2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="500" align="left">
  Finally, he comes out of the building.  "I'm so sorry that took so long," you say.  "I feel really bad for asking you now.  I thought you'd be in, they'd
  check your id, help you download the app, and then be done.  What on earth did they do that took so long?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Well, it started like you said," Andrew explains. "But then they had training on how to use the app.  And then much more training on..."  He pauses for
  a second before continuing.  "On how to help us make the most of this experience.  On how to use the belt's punishment and reward features to help
  encourage proper behavior, on how..."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Wait... Did you say punishment?", you interrupt.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Right.  It shocks you," Andrew explains.  "There's different levels, but they all sound very unpleasant.  There's pretty severe automatic ones which
  would happen if you cheated on me, though obviously you never would.
  <<if setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    But remind me to keep my phone charged and with me if we are ever fooling around outside of my apartment.  Otherwise it might get confused and punish you
    by mistake.
  <</if>>
  Oh, and if you try to use the app on my phone it triggers an automatic punishment too.  So definitely don't try that.
  Didn't they go over all this with you before you put it on?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I knew it would stop me from cheating on you, but I guess I didn't ask how, or really very many other questions.  Maybe I should have.  But I just knew I
  need this if I was going to be able to trust myself to stay
  <<if $sex.length>>faithful to<<else>>chaste for<</if>>
  you."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Ok.  Well, I can also trigger manual punishments," he continues.  "Not that I would do that to you.  But it would be if you were doing something bad but
  that the belt couldn't detect.  One of the examples they gave was if you were drunk at some party, and getting naked in front of everyone.  But, obviously
  you'd never do that.  And I can also trigger rewards.  The belt can
  <<if setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    stimulate you as much as I tell it to, even giving you an orgasm if I set that."
  <<else>>
    ... stimulate you, if you understand what I mean."
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You blush at the thought of Andrew pressing a button and then this belt teasing your most intimate places right here in public.
  "It also shows me here how much you liked that idea," Andrew says holding up the app and showing you an 'arousal level'.
  <<if $sex.length == 0>>
    "That's nothing to be ashamed of, it's a perfectly natural reaction."  That may be true, but that doesn't mean you aren't still embarrassed.
  <</if>>
  You realize Andrew is soon going to be acutely aware whenever you are aroused, probably seeing it on his app even before you consciously realize it.
  You hope he doesn't want to leave you when he realizes how much you are always thinking about sex.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Andrew continues, "Anyway, you should probably check the manual they are emailing you to learn everything it can do.  But keep in mind, I can't do everything it says
  in there, since I only have limited privileges while they are testing it.  I can't unlock you for example.  And threre's some other settings they have
  locked in as well.  Some of them obviously won't matter for us.  [[Others you may start to notice.|Part15MinistryTesterAndrew2]]

<<nobr>>
  You realize it's started to get warm this afternoon as you and Andrew eat lunch outside.  You are distracted as you eat your meal, and
  don't even finish it.  As you look at Andrew, your thoughts keep drifting back and forth between how much you care for him and between
  remembering how good his hands felt
  <<if setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    sliding up your thighs.
  <<else>>
    under your shirt.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Have I told you how much I love you?", you ask as you stare into his eyes.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I love you too," Andrew says as he strokes your hair softly.  You find yourself leaning in to his hand, loving the feel of it against your head.
  Then he smiles and says, "And yes you have told me.  Including three times this meal already.  Not that I mind though."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You laugh a little and say, "Oh.  Well, I just feel very affectionate today for some reason.  Part of it is probably that I'm so happy you
  that you were so understanding about this, and not being upset with me for needing it in the first place."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You continue, "I hate that you have to go back to work now.  I'd rather spend the whole day with you.
  <<if setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    I know you have to go now, but I wish we had a little time alone before you had to go.  I really want you right now.
  <</if>>
  But can I have a kiss before [[you leave|Part15MinistryTesterAndrew3]]?"
  <<if !setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    You are thinking about wanting so much more than a kiss, but you aren't going to say that.

	<h1>After Andrew Leaves</h1>
  <img src="Part15/Ministry4.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="650" align="left">
  You don't want your kiss to end, but it only lasts a moment.  Then Andrew has to head back to work.  He's barely left and you feel it start to get
  cooler outside.  But no one else seemed to have noticed it getting warmer earlier and cooler now, so maybe it's just you.  One thing you know is
  just you is the longing you feel to be with Andrew again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Thankfully, you have a date planned with him this evening, so you won't have to wait that long.  But still, as you are back in your room a few hours
  seem like an eternity.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The time alone does give you time to think.  
  <<if setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    You think about how much you want Andrew inside you.  But you realize that won't be possible now.  Why won't they let Andrew unlock you,
    even when it's just you two.  You couldn't cheat then.  He could lock it back on afterwards.  But he made it clear they won't let him do that.
    <br><br>
    You'll still be able to enjoy the feel of Andrew's skin against your again.  To feel his hardness in your hand, to taste it in your mouth.
    But you won't be able to feel his tongue circling your clit again, or your lower lips parting as he slides into you
    <<if setup.haveFuckedVaginal('Andrew')>>
      again.
    <<else>>
      for the first time.
    <</if>>
    <br><br>
    But the more you think about it, the more you are just looking forward to hearing him moan and then tasting his warm cum in your mouth.
  <<else>>
    You think about how good it felt when you and Andrew had messed around before, but that you never let him
    get past "second base".  You wanted to go further, you wanted it so bad, but you knew if his hand went down your pants, you wouldn't have
    been able to stop there.
    <br><br>
    And you'd also worried that once you started having sex, you might lose control.  You'd heard from some of the other girls at the X-Change meetings,
    and you'd worried you wouldn't be able to stay faithful.
    <br><br>
    But now you don't have to worry about either of those.  You know that neither you or Andrew could get the belt off, so you won't be going all the way
    even if you wanted to.  Not even with Andrew, and certaily not with anyone else.  And you feel safe that the belt will prevent you from cheating on
    him in any other way too.
    <br><br>
    You want to bury Andrew's head between your legs tonight.  But you realize that isn't possible either.  You'll have to just settle for doing that
    for him, without the hope of anything in return.  The more you think about it, the more you are looking forward to seeing what he looks like down
    there, what he tastes like.

  <h1>On a date with Andrew</h1>
  <img src="Part15/Ministry5.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="650" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  As you and Andrew are out on your date, you find yourself wanting to be close to him, even more than normal.  You also feel yourself getting warm again.
  But unlike earlier today, you are inside this time, so it can't be the weather.  When you mention it to Andrew he says the temperature feels fine.  After
  a moment he adds, "Oh, it's probably the bonding mode on your belt.  It's supposed to gently stimulate you whenever you and I are close.  I was
  skeptical when they said you wouldn't feel it, but it would still work.  But I guess they were right."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When he sees your confused look he asks, "Is it not covered in the wearer's guide they sent you?  Or have you just not had a chance to read it yet?"
  He unlocks his phone and shows you one of the screens in his app.  It says "bonding mode" at the top and is marked as "Active".  As you glance at it you
  see settings for intensity, Maximum Distance, maximum arousal, and sleep window, but it looks like all the settings are locked at their current values.
  "It's not bothering you is it?", Andrew asks with a hint of concern in his voice.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "No, no, not all," you answer as you pull closer to him.  "Actually, it's great.  I love the way I've been feeling around you today.  And now I don't have
  to worry that I'm coming down with a fever or something.  I might just have to dress a little lighter when you're around."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He smiles at that.  Then you add, "I hope they bring our check soon.  I'm really ready for us to [[get home|Part15MinistryTesterAndrew5]]."
<</nobr>>

::Part15MinistryTesterAndrew5

  <h1>After your date</h1>
  Your hands are all over Andrew as soon as you through the door.  You don't know how much of the need you feel for him right now is because of
  what the belt is doing and how much is natural.  You don't care either.  You just want to be close to him.  Actually, what you really want right
  now is him inside you, but you know you can't have that.  So his lips on yours is fine for now, for a start.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When his hand finds its way under your shirt, you quickly pull off the shirt and toss it aside.  He then begins to stroke your breast, then to tease
  your nipple through your bra.  You are about to take off your bra for him too when you see the bulge in his pants.  You decide to take something else off
  instead.

    Andrew is a bit surprised as you fumble at the buckle to his pants, but he quickly helps you take them off.  Your quickly pull down his underwear too
    as he takes off his shirt.

    You always love the moans Andrew makes, and they are turning you on even more than normal this evening.  But soon you notice something else.

    You hadn't realized how much the moans Andrew is making would turn you on.  It makes you want to keep going to make him moan even more.  You were right
    about one thing, if you weren't in this belt, you would have already climbed on top of him and started riding his cock.  But after a moment
    you can feel something else.
  <</if>>
  <<if $tempAcademicProbationDenialRelease>>
    <<unset $tempAcademicProbationDenialRelease>>
    After so long on the dean's denial, you recognize the new sensations instantly.
  <<else>>
    It's soft at first so it takes you a moment to realize it.  But soon the sensations are unmistakable.
  <</if>>
  The belt is stimulating you, noticeably this time, as you suck Andrew's cock.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral and setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    As if you needed any more encouragement to suck Andrew's cock.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The longer you suck his cock, the more more intense the vibrations from the belt get.  Soon you can feel yourself on the edge of an orgasm.
  Before you can cum though the belt eases off on the vibrations.  That makes you want to suck his cock even more, hoping to get the belt
  to start up again like before.  Soon you are taking his cock deep into your mouth, and not wanting it out except long enough to occasionally
  catch your breath.  After a while the vibrations pick back up again, keeping you constantly on the edge of an orgasm.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are desperate for an orgasm by the time he cums.
  <<if !setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    You are surprised by how much you love the feeling and the taste of his warm cum hitting your tongue and filling your mouth.
  <</if>>
  You keep sucking a bit longer as he cums, hoping for just a bit more from the belt to put you over the edge.  But then the belt kicks into
  high gear or something and you get quite a bit more.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  His cum oozes down your face as you scream out before you can even swallow his cum.  The vibrations continue as you hold onto him for support as
  your body shakes with a powerful orgasm.  The vibrations continue a while longer.  Just when you think you can't take it anymore, they slowly
  die down.  You lie down next to him with a messy smile on your face.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "That was amazing!", you tell him.
  <<if !setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
    "Why weren't we doing this sooner?  Can

<<nobr>>
  As soon as he is ready, you go again.  The vibrations continue as before, keeping you on the edge as you suck his cock.  But it doesn't give
  you the orgasm at the end.  He's left happy and drained, but you are still horny.  You want to know if he can go again, but he says not tonight.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "They said it would be random.  The orgasms while you, you take care of me, that is.  After the first one anyway," Andrew says.  "They recommended
  that over the other option which would have made you give me more and more each day.  I agree.  This way, you could get one at any time.  That seems
  much more exciting for you, I think.  Besides, as wonderful as that was, I can only take so many of those."  He gives you a smile as he strokes your hair.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "But we can try again tomorrow?", you ask hopefully.  He happily agrees.  After you clean up your face, you give him an kiss goodnight before
  [[heading home|Part15MinistryTesterAndrew6]].

  When you get home, you decide you should probably read that "Wearer's Guide" they emailed you.  After seeing some of the possible options,
  you follow the instructions and download the app.  You can see the "Oral Encouragement" and "Bonding Mode" settings active, and an indiator that the guide
  says means there are enabled settings or features that you don't have permissions as wearer to see.  Maybe you can ask Andrew about those.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  All the "Bonding Mode" settings are locked for you too, but looking at "Oral Encouragement" you see there's one setting you can change.  It says
  "Minimum Daily Target" and it's set at "0".  You click the "+" and see it change to "1".  It then tells you you'll be punished the next morning if you
  don't give Andrew at least that many blowjobs every day.  You also see you that the "-" button is disabled still, you wonder if it is for Andrew or not.
  Either way, one seems like a reasonable goal.  To easy even.  You wouldn't want to settle for one.  You click the "+" again and watch it change to "2".
  Even if Andrew isn't able to lower it, you don't think he'll mind.

  You find a guy and head back to his room with him.  As soon as you pull out his cock, you wish you weren't in this belt.  You can only imagine what
  it would feel like inside you.  But at least you don't have imagine trying to fit it all in your mouth.

  But you've barely started sucking his cock when you feel a shock from the belt, pain radiates out from your clit.  You try to ignore it and a few
  moments later are hit with another, strong shock.  You have to stop.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But seeing his hard cock alone, begging for attention, you don't want to stop.  You don't know how the belt knows you are sucking his cock, they didn't
  explain any of the technical stuff to you.  You doubt they even cover that in the manual you haven't bothered to read yet.  You try sitting up and
  stroking his cock instead.  You hear moans from him, but don't get any shocks.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You play a porn video on his computer as you are grabbing the lube from his desk.  At least you can watch some other girl ride a cock today, even if
  you can't.  You keep stroking and soon you can feel his magnificent cock stiffen and then twitch in your hand.
<</nobr>>

  You can't resist leaning over and licking the cum from his cock.  You've licked it mostly clean when the shock hits, but thankfully just the lower
  intensity one again.

	<h1>RTFM</h1>
  As you head home, you are feeling guilty about your failure.  You didn't even last a day in your belt and you were already trying, and failing,
  to give a blowjob to a guy you'd just met.  You are curious about how the belt knew you were doing it though, and why it shocked you for it.
  So you start looking through the manual they sent you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  First you follow the instructions and download the app.  While it's syncing up, you keep looking through the manual.  You spot something called
  'Oral Encouragement Mode'.  It would actually give you orgasms for giving blowjobs.  You wonder why the hell you didn't get that options.  "Because
  I told them I wanted to stop being a slut, not to turn myself into an even bigger one," you say to yourself.
<</nobr>>
<img src="Part15/TestSubject4.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450">
<<nobr>>
  When you get to "Chaste" mode in the manual, you eyes are quickly drawn to "Orgasm Request".  It says that you can request an orgasm.
  It says that occasional requests will usually be granted.  You quickly go to the app and find the request option.  "Request Denied" it comes
  back with instantly.  "Only good girls are rewarded with orgasms," it tells you below that.  "You have made 2 attempts at sexual activity.  As a
  result, no orgasm requests will be granted for a minimum of 4 days."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Shit", you think.  "It counted me trying to give him a blowjob and me licking him clean after jerking him off as two different attempts.  Now
  I have to wait twice as long.  I guess I'll just need behave myself for the next several days.  Maybe it'll be easier knowing I might be able
  to get an orgasm then.  And that anything else will get me punished."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You look through the manual some more, but most of it doesn't seem to apply to you.  There seems to be three main ways to use the belt, for
  chaste girls like you, for sluts that want to to be teased and denied, and for couples.  Well, you suppose you should read up on the couples settings
  later incase you meet someone while you're wearing this.  But not tonight.  You decide to get some sleep, you have that meeting at the
  You realize you are going to have to get more creative if you want to have any chance to defeat this belt.  You decide to dig into the documents
  the X-Change office tomorrow [[about their new 'Buddy' program|Part15Buddy]].

::Part15MinistryTester4
<<nobr>>
	<h1>Reading the manual</h1>
  <img src="Part15/TestSubject4.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  As you read throught he manual, you blush at some of the options.  Most of them definitely seem geared to girls that want to wear the belt
  to help the be <b>more</b> slutty, not less.  Some of the other options look to be intended for couples.  You can feel yourself getting aroused
  as you think of your future husband using some of them on you.  But you try not to twell on that section.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The "Chaste" mode is obviously the one they've set your belt to, thankfully.  The options for that seem fairly normal.  It says it will provide
  punishment shocks of increasing severity if sexual activity is attempted.  It doesn't really say how it can tell that, but you assume they'd
  probably not want to say exactly as that would make it easier to cheat it.  It does mention a "safe word" to yell if you are attacked and it
  will not trigger the punishment but instead call for help, "that's a nice feature," you think to yourself.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your eyes then fix on the section labled "Orgasm Request".  It says that you can request an orgasm and that occasional requests will usually be granted.
  You are still aroused from your earlier thoughts, so you decide to try it out.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You get comfortable in your bed, pull up the right page in the app.  Then you lie back and start thinking about your wedding day, though you quickly
  move to thinking about your wedding night.  You imagine your husband carrying you into the honeymoon suite then helping you out of your wedding dress.
  He lays you down on the bed, naked except for your chastity belt.  Then he unlocks and slowly removes it from you.  You reach over to your phone and
  press the "Request Orgasm" button.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You lie back close your eyes and start imagining your new husband begin to pleasure you.  You are expecting the belt to do someting, to give some
  real fealing to your fantasy, but nothing happens.  You stop fantasizing and wait a bit, but nothing.  You look back at the phone thinking thinking
  something went wrong, but you see, "Request Granted". And below that, "You've been a good girl.  Enjoy your orgasm."  But still nothing is happening.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You go back to the manual and read more and then you see that even though your request was granted, the reward isn't given to you immediately, or at
  last not usually.  It can be anytime in the next 48 hours.  The manual says that lets you receive rewards for good behavior and occasional satisfaction
  without becoming addicted.  The manual wasn't clear on what 'occasional requests' meant, but it seems like you probably need to wait at least two days
  between requests then, or at least two days after one was granted before requesting another one.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<set $tempOrgasmRequestGranted to 1>>
  You decide you best go to sleep then.  You have no idea if you'll be woken up in the middle of the night with a pleasan surprise, or not, and you want
  to be well rested.  You have the meeting tomorrow at the X-Change office [[about their new 'Buddy' program|Part15Buddy]].

  You've been at this university, and in this department, long enough to know how things work.  "Sir, this program is a tremendous opportunity for me,
  and I really don't want to lose it," you tell him as you walk behind his desk.  "I'm willing to do whatever it takes to stay in the program,"
  you say as you drop to your knees and begin to unbuckle his pants.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I do have another option," he says as you begin to suck his cock.  He waits to explain more until after you've made him come.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "That was wonderful.  Now the other option," he continues finally.  "You're familiar with the project Kyle has been working on, right?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know about the computerized chastity belt Kyle was trying to perfect last year.  You'd really hoped to continue with your own projects, but
  if being Kyle's assistant or something for a month or two lets you stay in the program, it's worth it.  "Yes, sir.  He was making excellent
  progress on his belt I recall," you answer.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "He has indeed.  We are hoping to to get it ready to market by the end of the school year.  And you can
  [[play a valuable part|Part15EngineerProbation2]] in that if you are interested.  And I can even get the dean to remove that horrible
  block they've placed on your orgasms," he says.  You of course say that you are interested.

  <h1>Meeting with the Engineering department head</h1>

  "We have beta testers testing out the belt.  They won't be testing here though, but on their own time.  They'll be testing 24/7 to be precise.
  That's how the belt is intended to be used, obviously.  So that's how we need to test it."  You start to feel sorry for the poor girls, but
  then you remember the belt can also generate orgasms if it's programmed to, so you expect they'll have a better time than your past few months
  on probation.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Part of your job will be compiling the data from their weekly questionnaires and the readings their belts sent back and creating reports
  based on that."  It sounds boring, but you are betting the questionnaires might be amusing to read.  And it keeps you on the project.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "We'll also be needing your technical expertise to test the belt's security.  We think it's secure, but we need you to perform some pentration
  testing on it."  He chuckles at his little pun.  "Do you think you are up to that?", he asks.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Yes sir," you quickly answer.  You pause to lick up a bit of cum you feel trailing down your face, getting the last bit with your finger before
  licking it clean. "That sounds very interesting, especially the security testing.  I'm definitely up for the challenge."  You want to make sure he
  doesn't forget about the other part he'd mentioned.  "And you'll be able to talk to the dean about my denial once I start?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Of course.  I've already cleared it with him," he says.  You realize he'd planned to allow you this other option long before you'd sucked his cock.
  He certainly wasn't going to stop you to tell you that though.  "I'll send an email over when you leave today.  You can head right over to the X-Change
  office to get that denial setting removed as soon as [[your fitting is done|Part15EngineerProbation3]]."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "My... fitting..," is all you can say in response.
<</nobr>>

  <h1>Your Belt Fitting</h1>

    <video src="Part15/Engineer3.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="700"></video>
  </div>
  "Of course.  We can have your fitting right now, then you can get to work right away testing," he says excitedly as he leads you back to the lab.
  <<if $PlayerChastityBelt>>
    Of course, I have the key for your old manual belt.  I'll send that back to <<if $Keyholder>>$Keyholder<<else>>your keyholder<</if>> for you.
  <</if>>
  You reluctantly follow him.  "What better test of the security could there be than a very well motivated, technical user, with full access to the
  specifications, source code, and schematics," he says clearly excited.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if setup.areDating('Kate') or setup.areDating('Veronica')>>
    You hope $dating[0] won't mind you agreeing to this without discussing it with her first, but you don't really have time.  And you really want to
    stay in the program.  You doubt that she'll be too upset that all the orgasms are hers until you are done with the testing.
  <<elseif $dating.length > 0>>
    You hope $dating[0] won't mind you agreeing to this without discussing it with him first, but you don't really have time.  And you really want to
    stay in the engineering program.  Hopefully you can still keep him happy with your mouth and ass until you are done with the testing.
  <</if>>
  You sigh with resignation as he begins measuring you in the lab.  
  <<if !$PlayerPregnant and $PlayerProtectionTry>>
    You suppose you'll just have to wait until your testing is done before you can try to get
    <<if $PlayerMother or $PlayerAbortion or $PlayerAdoption>>pregnant again.<<else>>pregnant.<</if>>
  <</if>>
  "The fit will adjust as you sleep
  <<if $PlayerPregnant>>
    though your pregnancy may test the limits of that feature.  Let me know if you have any issues and I'll make manual adjustments," he tells you.
    "And let me know when you have any doctor appointments so we can make arrangements for that."
  <<else>>
    to adjust for any weight gain or loss.  But let me know if you have any issues and I'll make manual adjustments," he tells you.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your heart stops for a second as he clicks the belt closed around your waist.  "Now, for your testing parameters.  You have two objectives.
  Both are their own reward, but will also come with a bonus payment as well:
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Your first goal is to have an unauthorized orgasm.  That means an orgasm that the registered 'owner' of the belt, me in this case,
  has not specifically authorized.  And I won't be authorizing any, so if you orgasm, then you've succeeded.  You just get one payment for each
  method you might discover, but feel free to enjoy the orgasms until we fix the flaw you've uncovered.  Once we believe it's been corrected,
  you'll be eligible for another payment if you can still orgasm that way, or find another flaw.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "You can use whatever means necessary with the belt still on for your orgasm.  Whether that's utilizing the parts of your body that aren't locked away,
  sneaking anything around or through the belt, vibrations, hacking the programming, whatever you want to try.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Your other goal, is to remove the belt entirely.  If you are able to remove the belt, then you've succeeded.  You can use any mechnical, electronic,
  really any means you want to accomplish this.  I'd be very careful trying to do anything destructive though.  As you know, this isn't simple steel here,
  and I don't want you to injury yourself.  We are fairly confident you won't succeed on this goal, but we'd like to know now if there is a flaw, rather
  than after it's on the market.  If you manage to escape, then you'll get an substantial bonus payable after you help us fix the flaw and you resume your
  testing." 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "And obviously the belt is yours to keep whenever the testing is complete."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are excited when you see what looks like a very pickable lock on the front cover.
  <<if $PlayerProtectionPill or $PlayerProtectionPerfect or $PlayerProtectionPermanent or $PlayerPregnant>>
    He sees you looking it at it and says, "You may be able to pick the hygiene shield lock.
  <<else>>
    But then he just hands you the key to it.  "You'll probably need to remove the hygiene shield once a month or so.
  <</if>>
  But you should read about the countermeasures in the specifications before you try to orgasm that way, or leave the hygiene shield off for too long."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<set $JobEngineerFormer to 1>>

  <<else>>
    [[start your testing|Part15EngineerProbation4]],"
  <</if>>
  he says. "Then you can head over to get the dean's denial turned off.  You should receive the technical information by the time you are finished.
  The same NDAs apply as always of course.  Good luck!"

    $dating is upset at first when you tell him about the belt.  But he starts to be more understanding when you explain how much you want to
    remain in the engineering program.  Or maybe his mood changed when you dropped to your knees and pulled out his cock.  Either way, he
    stopped complaining about the belt, at least for now.
  <<else>>
    It doesn't take you long to find guys willing to help you try to orgasm with your belt still on.  Well, they are trying to orgasm with your
    belt still on, you aren't sure they care much if you do.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Now that the dean's denial has been lifted, you were too eager to try to orgasm, so you hadn't bothered to check all of the settings your boss had given
  your belt.  You quickly discover one of them as you start on <<if $dating.length>>$dating<<else>>the first guy<</if>>'s cock.  You think you feel
  something as soon as his cock hits your tongue, but after you work it a while, there's no doubting the belt is stimulating you while you suck his cock.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>
    As if you needed any more encouragement to suck cock.
  <<else>>
    You only planned on sucking him for a little while, then having him fuck your ass.  But now you don't want to stop.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral > 2>>
    You loved giving blowjobs before, the warm pleasure that spread through your body anytime you had a cock in your mouth.  But with the added
    stimulation from the belt, you are sure you'll be able to cum while you suck his cock.  You are approaching an orgasm quickly, and are confident you
    are about to beat the belt already.
    <br><br>
    The vibrations quickly slow and then stop altogether, but you are already so close.  You enthusiastically keep working his cock, focusing on how
    good it feels in your mouth, and imagining that wonderful feeling when his cum hit your tongue.
    <br><br>
    But just when you think your orgasm is a moment away, you feel a shock, right against your clit.  The pain is just for an instant, and then it's gone.
    But it's enough to drive your orgasm back.  A few moments later, you are reveling in the taste of his cum, but there's no orgasm for you like you'd
    hoped.
    <br><br>
    You don't care about the shock, it wasn't that bad, and it felt so good before then.  You can't wait to you can give your next blowob.  You hope
    now that you are expecting the shock, it won't surprise you and prevent your orgasm like this time.  It'll take several more blowobs before you
    accept how naive that hope was.
  <<else>>
    You <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>loved<<else>>enjoyed<</if>> giving blowjobs before, but you soon discover you are going to
    <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>love it even more<<else>>absolutely love it<</if>> now.
    You eagerly suck his cock, hoping he doesn't cum before you do.  You know if he lasts long enough, the vibrations the belt is giving you will make
    you cum.  But as you start to get close to your orgasm, you feel the vibratons start to fade until they are just a soft, pleasant buzz.  A bit later
    they pick up again, keeping you tantalizingly close to an orgasm, but never letting you cum.
    <br><br>
    Your hand instinctively reaches between your legs and hits hard steel, or rather titanium-carbon-fiber-whatever, you don't really care right now.
    You keep sucking his cock because you don't want the pleasure to stop.  It isn't much longer and he his filling your mouth with cum.  You suck a bit
    longer as the belt ramps the vibrations up to high again.  But it only leaves it there just long enough to leave you right on the edge before stopping.
    <br><br>
    You keep trying later with more blowjobs, hoping the belt will make a mistake and go too far one of the times, or see if playing with your
    breasts, or anything else, will give you the bit extra you need, but it's still not enough.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once you've given up, for now at least, trying to get an orgasm from giving blowjobs, you start looking through the documentation.  You download the app
  as well.  You aren't surprised to see your access as 'wearer' is very limited.  You can see some of the settings.  You see that the 'Oral Encouragement'
  feature is enabled.  You also see that it would have given you an orgasm from that very first blowjob, but a general orgasm block setting prevented it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You think about trying to setup a packet sniffer to see if you can see anything in the data the app is sending that might help.  But you quickly realize
  that after the teasing and edging the belt gave you, you are too horny to focus on that right now.  For tonight you'll need to try something that doesn't
  require as much thought.  Luckily sucking cock [[isn't the only option|Part15EngineerProbation5]] the belt has given you.

      You don't care about the shock, it wasn't that bad, and it felt so good before then.  You can't wait to he can fuck your ass again.

      times before you accept how naive that hope was.
    <</if>>
  <<else>>
    By the time his cum fills your ass you are on the verge of an orgasm, but he seemed to cum just a moment too soon.  It felt so good though,
    you want to try again hoping he can last a little longer the second time.
    <br><br>
    He does last longer, but you are left right on the edge again, aching for just that little bit more that would let you cum.  You realize the
    belt must be softly stimulating you, just enought to slowly push you right to the edge, but never pushing you the rest of the way.

  You accept now that you aren't going to be able to cum this easily, but you also love how good it feels just to try.

  You were eager to be with $dating[0], and you hadn't bothered to check all of the settings your boss had given your belt.  You quickly discover
  one of them.  You think you feel something as soon as your tongue first tastes her, but after you continue for a while and she gets more and
  more wet from your attention, there's no doubting the belt is stimulating you while you pleasure her.
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>
    As if you needed any more encouragement to eat her out.

    You might have switched to your fingers after a while, but now you don't want to stop.

  You hope as you keep going the pleasure will keep building, but as you start to get close the vibrations lessen until you can barely feel them.

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  $dating[0]'s orgasm isn't going to be denied though.  She holds your head against her as she screams out with an orgasm.  You throb as you
  ache for one too.  But you feel the pleasure fade away as the belt stops stimulating you after your tongue leaves $dating[0].
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You try several more things, but the belt seems to only stimulate you when your tongue is on or inside $dating[0].  She doesn't mind though
  and lets you experiment with trying to orgasm from eating her out as much as you want.  Eventually she tries some of her toys on you.  The dildo
  is your ass feels nice, but isn't going to get you off.  Fucking her with a strap-on is fun as always, but you don't get those teasing vibrations.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You quickly discover not to try to generate your own vibrations.  She tries her magic wand against your belt.  You can feel the vibrations, but
  they are damped by the belt.  Even so, if she kept it up long enough you might be able to cum.  But the belt ensures that won't happen.  After a few
  seconds with the vibrator you feel a painful shock hit your clit.  Another one hits a second or two later.  They stop once she pulls the vibrator
  away.  "Well, I guess we won't be trying that then," she says.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You accept now that you aren't going to be able to cum easily in this, but you still love how you feel when you eat $dating[0] out, so you

<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You've been dreading this meeting.  You knew the denial effect from the dean's punishment would be a problem for the testing they do on you.  You'd
  hoped to be off of academic probation before it was time to return, but just hoping for it didn't make it happen.  Now you have to go meet with someone
  about it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know what the meeting is about your probation but you don't know what they are going to say.  Are you getting fired?  Are they going to have you
  cleaning up the mess you and the other subjects always leave in the testing rooms until you get off probation? Have they worked something out with
  the dean.  You really hope it's that last one.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't whether to show up looking sexy and willing to do anything the supervisor wants to keep your job, or whether to try to look like a good
  student who is working on improving her grades.  After struggling with it a bit, you try to find a middle ground and then head to your meeting.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you get there you meeting with the department head.  "We are meetng with all of the test subjects from your cohort, but given your special
  circumstances, I thought it best to meet with you individually," he starts.  "You won't be participating in the same sort of testing you were
  last year.  A new batch of incomming freshmen will be starting in your place."  You wonder if he is firing all of you then?  But then he continues,
  "But we have another opportunity for you all.  And in your case the offer also includes having the dean lift your orgasm block."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "We are in the beta testing phase of an exciting product we hope to be placing on the market soon," you were already sold on participating
  as soon as you heard that you'd get your orgasms back.  Then he starts to explain the product, "It is a computerized
  chastity belt."  Great. So you'll be trading one form of denial for another one, you think.  "I can see your disappointment, but it's not
  as simple as that.  This belt doesn't just deny your pleasure, it can also give you pleasure.  It all depends on the settings used, and we will
  be using a variety of them during the beta testing.  I can guarantee you'll have more orgasms help us with this than you would staying on the
  dean's denial list.  And obviously the belt will be yours to keep at the end of testing."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You'll get to keep your job, <b>and</b> orgasm again.  Of course you agree to participate in the beta testing.
  <<if $dating.length>>
    You hope $dating[0] isn't angry with you for agreeing without discussing it first.

  "Great, let's head over to the lab right now [[for your fitting|Part15TestSubjectBetaTest]] then," he says.

  You are bit early and have a chance to talk to some of the other girls that started as test subjects last year, just like you.  You recognize some
  of them from the X-Change orientation and other events as well.  Some of the others you don't.  But that makes sense, since they've been testing
  women both born that way, and recently transformed thanks X-Change.  But none of you know what the meeting is supposed to be about, only that
  it was mandatory that you attend.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The four of you go into the meeting and wait.  By the time the department head comes up to the front of the room, nearly all the other test subjects
  that joined at the same time you did are there.  "Welcome back, ladies," he begins.  "I have some bad news for you and some good news.  I'll start
  with the bad.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The testing program you were working on last year, won't be needing any of you this year.  I want to thank you all for your participation.
  You have helped a great deal in helping us evaluate and perfect our potential products.  You've also helped advance science, we now have much
  more data on the female orgasm and how it varies from woman to woman as well whether or to what degree X-Change transformation affect them...
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "However, we have gathered all of the data we need from all of you.  We are now very familiar with the nature, quality, and many other details
  of your orgasms, and many other details.  For any of you that would like a personal report of your own data, let one of the research
  assistants know and they will send it to you.  But don't worry, even though your participation is ending, the experiments, but with a new cohort
  of test subjects starting soon.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "The good news for all of you though, is that while your participation as test subects has ended, we have another exciting opportunity for you.
  We have a new product that we hope to be bringing to market soon, and we'd like all of you to test it.  The pay will be the same as you were
  receiving as a test subject, and you will only rarely need to visit the lab here.

  "Now, I'm sure you're wondering what the product is.  It is a computerizd chastity belt," but before any of you get up leave let me explain
  a few of it's features.  This belt doesn't just deny your pleasure, it can also give you pleasure.  It all depends on the settings used, and we will
  be using a variety of them during the beta testing.  I can guarantee you will have an amazing orgasm today if you agree, and many more during
  your testing.  If you'd like to know more about what to expect, you can read through the 'Wearer's Manual' we will provide if you participate.

  "I know at least one of you is pregnant, so I will disclosure one feature now.  The belt's fit auto-adjusts as you sleep, so it will expand

  First they have you sign the non-disclosure agreement he mentioned.

    Then, before removing your current chastity belt, they restrain you.  "Sorry this is necessary," he tells you.  "But it was the one condition

    your restraints are removed.

  <<if $PlayerProtectionPill or $PlayerProtectionPerfect or $PlayerProtectionPermanent or $PlayerPregnant>>

  <<else>>
    Oh, and here's the key to the hygiene shield in the front there, try not to lose it.  You'll probably need to remove the hygiene shield
    occasionally when you're menstrating.  But don't leave it off too long, or try to use it for anything other than its intended purpose, or
    you'll regret it.  You can read in the manual about the countermeasures if you are curious."
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He's clearly expecting you to leave at that point.  "Ummm... he... the department head, said we'd get an orgasm," you ask meekly as
  instinctively you already realize there's nothing you can do if they decide to change their mind.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Not right now.  We have quite a few girls to get fitted, and that would take forever.  But it is set to give you one sometime today," he tells you
  quickly, eager to get on to the next fitting.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "But if you don't feel like being patient, the 'Oral Encouragement' feature should speed it along.
  You can look over the manual when they send the link out, but I'm guessing you don't want to wait for that either.  I'm sure you can
  [[find a friend and figure it out|Part15TestSubjectBetaTest2]] on your own before then."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Oh, and if you were the one on academic probation, be sure to stop by the X-Change office when you leave here to get that taken care of," he adds

  <<if $AcademicProbationDenial>>
    <<unset $AcademicProbationDenial>>
    After a quick visit to the X-Change office to get the probation denial setting removed, you head back over to the student center.
  <</if>>
  It doesn't take you long to find a guy willing to help you try to trigger the orgasm you were promised.  Well, he probably doesn't care if that
  hppens or not, but he is certainly willing to let you suck his cock if that's what it takes.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It also doesn't take you long to figure out what the 'Oral Encouragement' feature does.  Just a few seconds after his cock is in your mouth,
  you can feel the vibrations start.  Gently at first, but picking up in intensity as the intensity of your blowjob increases.
  You <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>loved<<else>>enjoyed<</if>> giving blowjobs before, but if this setting stays on, you are going to
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>love it even more<<else>>absolutely love it<</if>> now.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know if he lasts long enough, you'll cum.  Your only worry is that he'll cum too soon, and the belt will stop.  But you don't want
  to slow down, and you only take his cock out of your mouth long enough to occasionally catch your breath.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But as you start to get close to your orgasm, you feel the vibratons start to fade until they are just a soft, pleasant buzz.  A bit later
  they pick up again, keeping you tantalizingly close to an orgasm, but never letting you cum.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are desperate for an orgasm by the time he cums.  You keep sucking a bit longer as he cums, hoping for just a bit more to put you over
  the edge.  But then the belt kicks into high gear or something and you get quite a bit more.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  His cum oozes down your face as you scream out before you can even swallow his cum.  The vibrations continue as you hold onto him for support as
  your body shakes with a powerful orgasm.  The vibrations continue a while longer.  Just when you think you can't take it anymore, they slowly
  die down.  You lie down next to him with a messy smile on your face.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As soon as he is ready, you go again.  The vibrations continue as before, keeping you on the edge as you suck his cock.  But it doesn't give
  you the orgasm at the end.  He leaves happy and drained, but you are still horny when he gone.  You try a few more times with a different guy, but
  you can't get another orgasm from it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You decide to give up for today and wait until the [["Wearer's Guide" email arrives|Part15TestSubjectBetaTest3]] to see how to trigger an orgasm again.
<</nobr>>

::Part15TestSubjectBetaTest3

  </div>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  The email finally arrives, and there's a number of featues you'll read up on later, but the "Oral Encouragement" feature is the one your status page
  says is active right now, and that's the one you wanted to focus on anyway.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote style="width: 35%;">
    The <b><i>Owner</i></b> may set an initial daily oral target for the <b><i>Wearer</i></b> when activating the Oral Encouragement feature.
    If no target is set, it will default to 1.  <b><i>Wearer</i></b> will receive encouraging stimulation throughout their oral service each time.
    Once the <b><i>Wearer</i></b> reaches her daily target, she will be rewarded with an orgasm (assuming no other feature is prohibiting this).
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Well, that's why it triggered an orgasm.  You keep reading.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote style="width: 35%;">
    The <b><i>Owner</i></b> may keep the daily target constant, increase it at constant or geometic rate, or leave it at the default "Personal Best"
    setting.  With the Personal Best setting the <b><i>Wearer</i></b>'s daily target will always be one more than her previous daily best.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Ok, well why didn't I get a second, third, and fourth orgasm then, you wonder.  As far as this thing knows those each exceeded my personal
  best too.  You keep reading to see if it explains that.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    Once the <b><i>Wearer</i></b> reaches her daily target, she will not receive any further orgasm rewards that day from Oral Encouragement feature.
    She will still receive encouraging stimulation for any oral service above and beyond her target and orgasms related to any other enabled features
    are still possible.
    <br><br>
    If the daily target is exceeded, then the actual number achieved that day, not the previous goal, will be used to calculate the next day's goal.
    This also applies if the goal was otherwise set to be fixed.  This will ensure that even if an initial goal is set too low, she will soon reach a
    level that she finds challenging thus encouraging constant improvement.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Wait, does that mean... You reread the passages serveral times.  You realize it's saying that you would have only had to give two blowjobs tomorrow
  for an orgasm.  But since you already gave four of them today, you'll have to give five tomorrow! Then six the next day, and... You wonder how long
  many orgasms you'll actually be able to get from this feature before you'll have to be spending all your free time sucking cock just for one orgasm.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Well, you figure it could have been worse.  You'd almost went out to find a third guy to try with.  At least stopping when you did gave you a few
  extra days before the targets get out of hand.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't see any other active features on your status page, just the one guaranteed orgasm he promised you today, but it's marked as complete.
  You do see it is set to count a new day as starting at 6 AM.  That's good, having it reset at midnight would have been annoying.  You go ahead and
  follow the instructions to download the app for your phone before [[going to sleep|Part15TestSubjectBetaTest4]].
<</nobr>>

  <img src="Part15/TestSubject4.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450">
  <<set $DailyBJMinimum to 1>>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You are awoken the next morning at 6 AM to your belt stimulating you again.  You feel yourself getting close to an orgasm, but at the
  last minute the vibrations stop abruptly.  You are left wide awake now and wanting more.  Your phone beeps with a notification. "Congratulations
  on exceeding your oral target of 1 yesterday.  Your target for today is 5."  And there is also another silent notification you had received before
  you woke up.  "Belt Configuration Change Received From Owner."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you check the app, it says that "Morning Wakeup" was enabled, and that it's set to wake you with an edge if you'd met your target, with
  'gentle teasing' if you did not.  You also see a "Minimum target" setting, but it says "0".  As you are looking at the settings on the page, you
  accidently hit the "+" next to the "0" and it instantly changes to a "1".  Below that it now says "if minimum daily target is not achived, punishment
  shocks will be used for Morning Wakeup routine.  You frantically try to hit the "-" to switch it back to zero, but it ignores you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Does that mean I have to suck a cock every day if I don't want to be punished now, you wonder.  You open up the manual again to see how to disable
  that. You don't see anything in the "Oral Encouragement" section but you do find a relevant passage elsewhere.  But it's not what you wanted to see.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    By default, if the <b><i>Wearer</i></b> desires to challenge herself, most settings will allow a manual increase in difficulty.  However any decrease
    in difficulty can only be authorized by the <b><i>Owner</i></b>.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't expect the chances of them doing that for you to be very high.  You go back to the app again, this time being extremely careful not to
  accidentally click anything.  You try to see what the other settings that changed were, but all you can see enabled are "Oral Encouragement" and
  "Morning Wakeup".  You do see a small indicator in the corner of the screen. When you check the manual it says it indicates that there are enabled
  settings or features hidden from the wearer.  You suppose you'll just have to wait and see what those might be.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You've been looking through the app and manual for a while when another notification pops up, a regular one from your calendar this time.  It's
  reminding you of the your meeting in an hour at the campus X-Change office [[about their new 'Buddy' program|Part15Buddy]].
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You quickly head to the shower.  An hour is plenty of time to get ready and get over there.  But you are hoping to be able to have some extra
  time to find someone to help you get that minimum daily target you set for yourself out of the way.  The rest of your goal for
  today will have to wait until after the meeting.

	<h1>Meeting with your 'Buddy'</h1>
  This year, for the incoming freshmen, they are again assigning natural-born women as mentors for the newly converted, to help them transition
  into their new bodies and new lives.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But they've figured out that not every challenge a newly converted woman will face will be something her natural-born mentor will have any experience
  with.  So this year they are also adding a new program where the previous years convertees are paired off with a freshman convertee to help give her
  first-hand advice.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="Part15/Buddy1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450" align="left">
  You can tell your buddy, Bailey, is a bit shy, and very naive and suggestible.  Bailey tells you she signed up for the Student X-Change Program
  because she wanted to know what it was like to be a woman, so she can be a better husband someday after she graduates and changes back.  You
  accept that that may be one of her goals, but you also know from experience she must at some level wanted to be a woman.  Maybe permanently,
  maybe just for a while, but you aren't going to force her to admit that to you or to herself.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  She gets money from her parents every week, and has her dad's credit card for expenses.  So you don't have to warn her about most of the jobs
  around here as she won't be needing one.  So
  <<if $PlayerPregnant>>
    given your current state, of course
  <</if>>
  the first topic you discuss with her is pregnancy.  You know if she really does want to change back after graduation, then she'll need to be careful.
  "They did have one slide on that," she tells you, "but it didn't really apply to me, so I just marked 'no' on the birth control stuff."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you press her on what she means when she said it didn't apply, she explains.  "I'm not planning on starting
  a relationship right now, I want to focus on school.  And even if I were, I'm not going to going to be having sex with guys. I'm not gay. Not
  that there's anything wrong with being gay.  I'm just not.  
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't point out that now that she is a woman now, so what is gay and what is not gay have reversed.  You understand what she was trying to say.
  But you also notice her checking out two cute guys that walk past, and also her face flushing when she notices them checking her out too.  She may
  have been interested in women before, but the X-Change seems to have made her interests more varied now.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "And birth control pills have side-effects sometimes. Not the X-Change kind of side-effects of course.  But I already have two of those X-Change
  side-effects, so I'd rather not add regular medicine side effects on top of it.  They used to give my sister horrible migraines until she switched
  to something else,"  when you ask about her X-Change side-effects she explains.  "I had them make sure I got the kind of body I wanted.  And they  
  did, I love the way I look now.  But they said I'd think more about sex than normal, which doesn't seem like a big deal to me.  I
  mean it's probably still going to be less than I thought about it as a guy, right?
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="Part15/Buddy14.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="600" align="left">
  "And they also said I'd be very passive... no 'submissive' was the word he used.  I was always kind of quiet, so I don't see how that's going to
  be any different now."  Your mind can't help but picture Bailey naked, cuffed, and ready to submit.  With that side-effect, you expect she'd enjoy
  that quite a bit no matter who it was controlling her.
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    You try to push the thought of her that way out of your head, but you can't help it.  Everytime you look at her now, you are imagining her
    like that.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>  
  You can tell she's not going to consider getting on the pill and you don't want to press it.  But otherwise she still seems open to your advice
  on the subject of avoid pregnancy.  Though you know she's probably not going to listen if you talk about condoms or pulling-out,
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    not just because you'd be embarrassed, but
  <</if>>
  because she still doesn't think that applies to her.  Maybe she's right.
  <<if $CampusMinistry>>
    And she's mentioned how she feels about religion, so you aren't even going to suggest talking to Mark or Faith.

  Bailey goes on telling how with all the women hiting on her, one girl there in particular caught her eye.  A cute sophmore name Ava.  You'd seen
  her in the bar a few times before last year.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "When we got back to her place, it was amazing," Bailey's face flushes a bit as she recounts her story.  "She knew my body so well and had me screaming
  with orgasm after orgasm all night.  And she was really understanding that I wasn't as good... as good at pleasuring her.  She said she plans on letting
  me get lots of practice learning.  We are meeting up for a second date tomorrow."

  You wonder if Bailey might be moving too fast with Ava, but then you figure that's natural too.  They are both adults.  Barely, but still they can
  make their own decisions.  You still suspect Bailey's at least a bit bi, but if she's going to be in a relationship with a woman, at least you won't
  have to worry about her getting pregnant.

  She doesn't suck his cock for very long as he was already near the edge.  A moment later he groans as he cums.  She eagerly keeps going until the

  He squirms a bit more as her lips slide off his cock with a small 'pop' sound.  She swallows the cum he'd given her and smiles at him.  "You gave me
  so much pleasure, I didn't want to deny you," she tells him.

  Once Peter is caged and untied, you talk with Bailey some more.  "Ok. You were right. I do like guys now," Bailey confesses.  "But I don't think
  I could keep one caged like that.  Even today, seeing his cock as he ate me out, I would have climbed on top it right then if I had thought you'd

  "I wouldn't have minded the treat for Peter," you tell her.  "But I would have been worried for you.  On top of the disappointment you would have had when he

  He says, "Hmmm, looks good so far.  But I think I'd need to see more to say for sure."  Bailey slowly starts to

  When she's down to her bra an panties, Bailey stops.  You start to kiss her.  As you do, you reach around and undo her bra.  She quickly does likewise
  on yours.  "Well, you both look amazing so far," $tempGuy says.
  <<if $PregnancyWeek > 10 || $BodyType == 'Plus' || $BodyType == 'Fit'>>

  "Yes, sir," you say as you start to move toward the sofa.  Bailey quickly answers with her own "Yes, sir," as she does the same.  You both

  <<if $BoyfriendStrictChastity or setup.areDating('Barry')>>
    gives it a good swat,
  <</if>>
  and then slowly pulls down her panties.  You can tell from her breathing that she is probably as wet as you are right now.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Looking away at first may have let Bailey believe she wasn't interested in guys for a few seconds longer, but you know as soon as
  $tempGuy's tongue slides between her lips for the first time, she has realized she was mistaken.  A few moments later when his tongue plunges
  into her newly created ass, you doubt she even remembers why she'd thought that in the first place.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  After a while $tempGuy turns his attention to you.  You can hear the small whimper from Bailey when his tongue leaves her.  After you enjoy
  $tempGuy's tongue a bit, you lean over slightly and, just loud enough that $tempGuy can hear too, tell Bailey, "If you want him to continue

  $tempGuy stands as Bailey drops to her knees.  She's a quick learner as she starts to suck his cock.  You wonder if she's fantasized about
  what giving a blowjob would be like before.  You expect she probably has many times, probably long before she learned about the Student X-Change

<<nobr>>
  <<if $PlayerSideEffectOral>>
    If she's anything like you, she would probably love to keep going until his cum filled her mouth.

    She is clearly enjoying being on her knees, doing as she was told.  Even though you know she aches to feel him inside her, she'd probably
    keep going if he told her to.

  But $tempGuy isn't going to pass up the chance to be the first to go where no man has been before.

    Not after how much he enjoyed being your first.

<<nobr>>
  You can see the look in Bailey's eyes as $tempGuy's cock slides into her.  And you can see the way she looks up at him as he start to fuck her.
  There was never a chance she wasn't going to end up in this position sometime this year.  But it's much better it is with someone
  <<if setup.areDating('Barry')>>mostly<</if>> safe like $tempGuy.  And with you there to watch.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know when $tempGuy is getting close, so you ask Bailey.  "He's about to cum inside you.  Do you want him to keep going?"  You can tell from
  the desperate need in her eyes what her answer is going to be.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Yes! Cum inside me.  Don't stop!  Please don't stop," she begs.  You warn her if she gets pregnant she won't ever change back to her old body.  Again
  You know what her answer will be. "Fill me with your cum. I don't care about my old body, I just need you inside me!" Bailey pleads with him not to stop.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  She's made it clear to $tempGuy what she wants, but you look up at him and gently shake your head 'No', letting him know not to listen to her
  and to pull out instead.  You don't know what part of it is natural hormones or something and what part is X-Change, but you know from experience
  she's not thinking clearly right now.  Thankfully you are thinking a bit clearer than her, so you can signal to $tempGuy, but let Bailey enjoy

      Barry decides to give her what she's begging for, and to ignore you.  You expect she feels too good for him to want to pull out now.
      He keeps going until he cums inside her.
    <<elseif $tempGuy == 'Peter'>>
      But she feels too good for Peter.  Before he realizes what you are trying to signal he's already came inside her.
    <<else>>
      But $tempGuy doesn't notice you signalling him.  Either that or he decided to follow her instructions instead of yours, because soon
      he is cumming inside her.
    <</if>>
    <br><br>
    As he does, it pushes her over the top and she cries out with her first orgasm. "Oh yes! Cum inside me!"  He thrusts a few more times.  You
    imagine what it feels like for her, in the throes of her first orgasm as $tempGuy's cock pulses inside her giving her all its cum.
    <<if either(0,1,2) == 0>>
      <<set $BuddyPregnant to $tempGuy>>

    She's still enjoying the bliss of her orgasm and doesn't realize the implications of what just happened.  You decide to let her enjoy the
    moment as long as she can before she starts to focus on the possible consequences.
    <br><br>
    You kneel and begin to clean the cum that's leaked out of her.  You love the familiar taste of $tempGuy's cum mixed with the new taste of
    her.  Soon, with your tongue circling her clit she's enjoying her second orgasm as she holds your head in place afraid you'll stop too
    soon.
  <<else>>
    <img src="Part15/Buddy21.gif" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450" align="right">
    You can see the reluctance in $tempGuy's eyes.  Both Bailey's begging and his own body are crying out for him to keep going.  But he pulls out
    and instead covers her stomach with his cum.  Bailey lets out a disappointed whimper, having needed just a little more before she could cum.
    <br><br>
    You kneel between her legs.  It doesn't take long for your tongue to finish the job, brining Bailey to her first orgasm.  You then lick
    clean the cum $tempGuy left. Some of it is still in your mouth as you crawl up to kiss Baily, sharing the cum with her as you kiss.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  With her still on her back, you straddle her face.  She quickly gets to work.  By the time you've came, $tempGuy is ready to go again.  This time,
  it's you he's fucking.
  <<if $PlayerPregnant>>
    And of course, he's going to cum inside you.  It's not like you can get more pregnant.
  <<elseif $PlayerProtectionWithdraw>>
    Normally you'd tell him to pull out. But
    <<if $tempCumInside>>
      you don't want Bailey to have all the fun,
    <<else>>
      you want to make it up to him for making him pull out with Bailey,
    <</if>>
    so you let him cum inside you this time.
  <<elseif $PlayerProtectionCondoms>>
    You were too lost in the moment to remind him to use a condom with Bailey, and you still aren't thinking about it now.
    <<if $tempCumInside>>
      You don't want Bailey to have all the fun,
    <<else>>
      You want to make it up to him for making him pull out with Bailey,

    As you eat her out, more of $tempGuy's cum leaks down.  You eagerly catch as much as you can, the rest drips down your face.

	<h1>Talking with Bailey about protection</h1>
  The next day you meet with Bailey again.  You explain what happened yesterday.  You don't even mention that she'd claimed to not be interested in
  guys.  It's obvious to her now how wrong she was there.  She had fun with you too, of course.  You think she's probably a bit bi, but with
  a preference for guys.  But you don't talk about that, just about the risk she took yesterday.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <img src="Part7/Start3B.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="400" align="right">
  "In the passion of the moment, you weren't thinking about the consequences at all.  I think right then you even wanted him to get you pregnant.
  Don't feel bad, it's like that for me sometimes too.  But I did
  <<if $tempCumInside>>
    try to protect you from yourself.  I signalled for $tempGuy to pull out.  But he was too lost in the moment also.  Or maybe he just ignored me
    and listened to you because that was going to feel better for him. 
  <<else>>
    protect you from yourself.  I signalled for $tempGuy to pull out.
    <br><br>
    But I won't always be there, and even if you remember to tell the guy, that doesn't mean he'll always listen.  Sometimes they'll cum too soon on
    accident. Sometimes they'll come inside you just because they know it will feel better for him.  Sometimes they actually want to get you pregnant.
  <</if>>
  It's not like the consequences are the same for him, is it?
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "So you know now that having him pull out isn't realiable.  You can't even count on yourself sometimes.  And I understand you not wanting to take
  the pill because of your family history.  But those aren't your only options.  There's also condoms."
<</nobr>> 

<<nobr>>
  "If you ask, some guys might complain about them, if they do, just tell them it's a condom or no sex at all, and they'll change their mind pretty quick.
  But It's better to not even ask.  If you put a condom on him the right way, he's not going to complain about it at all.  Let me show you."
<</nobr>> 

<<nobr>>
  You pull out small box of condoms you'd bought on the way over.  You take one out and demonstrate on the realistic dildo you'd also purchased.  Once
  you've shown her, you let her practice until you are out of condoms.  By then, it's clear she'll be able to get it on him using her mouth alone.
  You know he'll be too busy moaning in pleasure to complain about anything.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Now, I want to make you remember this lesson.  So pull down your panties, lift up your skirt, and bend over," you order.
<</nobr>>

<video src="Part15/Buddy8.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="500"></video>

<<nobr>>
  Her submissive nature shows again, and you can sense her excitement at being ordered like that.  "Y..yes, ma'am", she says as complies with your orders.
  You can tell she's expecting to be spanked, but instead you pull out the new butt plug you'd bought.  You wet it in your mouth before sliding into her
  ass.  She lets out a soft moan as you do.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Now, you are to keep that in your ass all day to remind you to go to the store and buy condoms.  I expect you'll need a big box of them.  You can't
  take it out yet though.  You need to go find a guy, any guy.  Just not $tempGuy.  And practice what you learned.  Once he's came for you, with the
  condom on, then you can take the plug out.  Understood?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<set $BuddyCondoms to 1>>
  You get an excited 'Yes ma'am' from her.  She's clearly excited to go follow your instructions so you tell her goodbye for now.

    later that I had started acting funny.  They thought I just couldn't handle my alcohol, and my friend Troy took me home when I couldn't walk straight

  "Oh," Bailey says.  "I guess maybe I should get one then."  You try not to smile as you relize you've convinced her.  You quickly head out with her
  to buy one before she has any second thoughts.  She's using her dad's credit card and isn't concerned about the price.  She's just impressed with the
  selection.  "Wow, it's great thet have them here in stock.  I guess they are really popular."  You realize she's right, they must be popular for them

  "If you have the key in your pocket, it isn't much protection is it?  They could just take it from you and unlock it.  Besides, it's best you wear it

  "Yes ma'am," she says as you've clearly coaxed out her submissive side.  "I guess I'll see you [[in a few days|Part15Week]] like we planned then."
  You can see her biting her lower lip before you turn towards the door.  You assume she's imagining how she was planning on masturbating for the first

  "But you should know, getting off as a woman usually takes a lot more work than it did as a guy," you warn her.  "Especially at first,
  when you are just learning how your body works.  We should probably get you a few toys, and definitely a good vibrator."
<</nobr>>

<video src="Part15/Buddy7.webm" autoplay loop muted height="500"></video>

<<nobr>>
  "Oh, that sounds great.  Do you want to go now?", she says excitedly.  You and her head down to the adult toy shop near campus and begin exploring
  the aisles.  You think it is her first time in a store like this, and obviously her first time in this body.  She wants to buy half the store.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Let's stick to the basics for now," you tell her.  "Once you learn what you like, you can always come back here for more."  You help her settle
  on a dildo.  She finds a pretty glass one she likes.  You think she's mainly just going on look, and are scared off from the more realistic
  cock-looking ones.  You don't mention that the one she picked out is intended for anal-play, it'll work either way.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You also get her a magic wand vibrator.  She's spending her dad's money, so there's no point in skimping, she might as well start with the best.  He'll
  see 'R. J. Boutique' on his credit card bill and just think she was buying clothes.  "With this one, you don't have to worry about running out of
  batteries at the worst time, and you can control how intense it is with this dial here," you explain to her.

::Part15BuddyToyPlug
<<nobr>>
	<h1>Teaching Bailey about toy safety</h1>
  The next morning you talk with Bailey on the phone, and she describes how after she had been playing with her vibrator and glass dildo
  for a while, the dildo was slick from being inside her.  She says she 'accidentlly' put it her butt once.  "It went in much easier than I would have
  thought.  And it felt much better than I thought it would have.  It's not wrong that I liked it is it?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  She isn't really looking for an answer and continues her story. "I'd just switch it back and forth from place to palce to keep it wet.  You were
  right, it took longer to orgasm than with my old body, but oh my god was it worth it.  I just laid there with the dildo in my butt still and the
  vibrator bouncing around the floor until my mind was there enough to move again."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You don't tell her, but you have to admit to yourself that her story made you wet, hearing about her first orgasm as a woman.  But one part of her
  story did concern you.  You'll have to teach her an important lesson and you know just how to make sure she'll remember.  You tell her you'll be over
  shortly and the two of you can go out for breakfast.  Before you leave you grab one of the new toys you'd picked up for yourself at the store,
  but hadn't used yet.
<</nobr>>

<video src="Part15/Buddy8.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="500"></video>

<<nobr>>
  When you get there you explain her mistake.  "You can't switch back and forth with a toy like you did.  At least not if you don't want to risk
  getting a UTI... an infection.  It's best to just keep your anal toys separate from your vaginal toys.  This is a very important lesson and I
  want to make sure you remember.  So pull down your panties, lift up your skirt, and bend over."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Her submissive nature shows and you can sense her excitement at being ordered like that.  "Y..yes, ma'am", she says as complies with your orders.
  You can tell she's expecting to be spanked, but instead you pull out the new butt plug you'd bought yesterday.  You wet it in your mouth before
  sliding into her ass.  She lets out a soft moan as you do.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Now, you are to keep that in your ass all day and your vagina empty, so you remember where anal toys are supposed to go.  Then later we can go
  back to the store and get you another dildo.  Then you'll have one for each hole.  You can even play with both at the same time if you like,"
  you instruct.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You see her eyes light up at the last part of your instructions, and you get a quick 'Yes ma'am' from her.  Later at the store, she buys you a
  new butt plug to replace the one you'd given her, and of course another dildo.  "Have a good evening," you tell her with a smile as you leave
  her room.  "I'll see you [[in a few days|Part15Week]] and you can tell me how well your new dildo works then."

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "After I got home I was thinking though.  I still don't want to take the pill.  But maybe I should pick up some condoms."

  Your friends Larry and Zane were checking out Bailey earlier, and she was clearly checking them out back.  It may be obvious to you that she has
  an interest in guys now, you were having no luck convincing her.  The X-Change people tell you in the presentation that your preference often change
  after your body does, but many people just don't want to listen.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You aren't going to have any luck talking to about birth control, but at least you know how to keep her from being unhappy for months denying who
  she really is now.
<</nobr>>

<img src="Part15/Buddy9.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450">
<<nobr>>
  You decide to introduce her to Larry and Zane, and they instantly hit it off.  She's new to flirting, as a woman at least, but her interest in them
  is clear to everyone.  Larry and Zane will only ever be friends to you, and you don't want to interfere with everyone else's fun, so you decide to
  say goodbye and leave Bailey with the guys.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know she's safe with them.  They'd never do anything to her.  Well, anything that she didn't want them to do.  Though you wonder if there's
  much she won't want them to do to her before the night is over.  "I have to run by the bookstore before it closes," you lie.  No
  one seems to much care.  "I'll [[give you a call tomorrow|Part15BuddyGuys2]]," you tell Bailey as you are leaving.  
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They are still talking when you look back a bit later.  Though from their body language, you expect they'll be heading up to one of the guy's
  room soon.

	<h1>Hearing about Bailey's Evening</h1>
  "Ok. You were right. I do like guys now. I really like guys now," is the first thing Bailey says as she sits down at your table.
  "I never did before, but I guess since my body is different, what I want is different too.  I should have listened to you."  She pauses for a second
  then continues.  "But thank you for introducing me to Zane and Larry.  Last night.  Last night was amazing."

  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Tell me everything," you say.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Well, not long after you left," she starts, "we decided to go up to Zane's room to talk more in private.  But we didn't talk very long.  Soon
  we were kissing.  I mean me and both of them.  It was overwhelming, feeling Zane's lips on mine, and Larry's on my neck.  And the smell of them...
  Guy's never smelled so wonderful before.
<</nobr>>

<video src="Part15/Buddy10.webm" autoplay loop muted height="500"></video>

<<nobr>>
  "When I felt... felt them getting hard, I couldn't help myself.  Before I knew it I was on my knees and unbuckling Zane's pants, and Larry's too.
  I didn't know what I was doing at first, but I was able to figure it out pretty quickly.  The hardest part was,", she giggles a bit.  "I mean the
  part I had trouble with was that wanted them both so much, but I couldn't only take one in my mouth at once.  I kept switching back and forth
  between them. 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "But when we moved to the bed, it got so much better."  You see a far away look in her eye and a smile on her face as she continues, "I continued
  sucking on Zane's cock.  And Larry went behind me.  When he slid inside me... It felt so good.  They switched back and forth a few times.  But then
  we tried something different.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Larry started playing with my ass while he was fucking me.  When he saw how much I liked that he asked if he could fuck me there instead.
  Of course I told him he could."  She finally starts to blush a bit, her story as just been pouring out.  You suppose she has to tell someone about
  this experience, and you are the only one she can talk to about it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When she continues she says, "Then they both started to fuck me.  One in my ass, and the other normally.  It was amazing, I wanted them to keep
  going forever.  Or... at least a little bit longer than they did.  But it must have felt as good for them too, because they couldn't hold back
  any longer."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "They didn't come inside you did they?", you ask.  Though you aren't really concerned about whichever one was in her ass at the time.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "No. They pulled out before then," she says to your relief.  "I told them to cum on my face.  It'd always looked so hot in porn I'd watched.  And
  they were happy to.  They both came so much all over my face.  I made me feel like such a slut.  But in a good way, if you know what I mean."  You
  don't say anything, but you definitely know what she means.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "They took turns eating me out after that, and it felt amazing," she continues her story.  "I'd never felt anything like the orgasm I had.
  It seemed to go on forever.  By the time it stopped, they were both hard again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "This time when they took turns. First Zane and then Larry.  Or maybe Larry, then Zane.  I guess it doesn't matter.  It was wonderful, one of the fucked
  me while the other played with my breasts, my clit, everything.  I'd had another orgasm before the the first one had came.  I had him cum inside
  me this time.  It's not like in porn though.  He went deep inside me when he came, and it felt amazing.  Then the other one kept going as soon
  as he was done, and I came again before he'd finished!"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Anyway, I got their info before I left.  They said we can do that again any time I want."  She starts to finish up her story.  "I'm sure I will,
  but first I think I want to try it again, with different guys.  Is that wrong?"
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You tell her of course not.  It's perfectly natural to want to explore.  Other girls have had years since puberty to experiment, she's had a day.
  "But you probably want to stop by the store and pick up some condoms," you warn her.  "If you don't want to take the pill, they are another option
  to avoid getting pregnant."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if either(0,1) == 1>><<set $BuddyCondoms to 1>><</if>>
  "I'll do that," she says.  Though you aren't sure if she actually will or not.  "When [[we meet up again in a few days|Part15Week]], hopefully I'll
  have another story or two to tell", she says hopefully before you two head in different directions.

    X-Change, at least normal X-Change, is that it feels amazing from the very first time."  She seems relieve by that.  "One bit of advice for your first time
    though.  If he hasn't already gotten you off before you start, don't be afraid to play with yourself while he's inside you.  Or for that matter, even if he
    has gotten you off.  Your body will take more work to get to an orgasm now, and I want your first time to be amazing."

  You and her keep shopping, collecting bag after bag of new clothes.  And several more phone numbers.  You remember how much you enjoyed getting to shop
  for your new body the first time too.  It puts a smile on your face seeing how happy it makes her.

  She seems especially excited when you come upon the lingerie store.

    "I don't mind if you want to wait out here," Bailey tells you.  "But I really want to check this store out."
  <<else>>
    "Oh, I've been wanting to find one of these," Bailey says excitedly.

    "It's ok," you tell her.  "I've seen underwear before."
    <<if setup.haveFucked('Andrew')>>
      You look for something nice to wear for Andrew.  Well for you too, you love the feeling wearing something sexy gives you.  And you
      especially love the way Andrew looks at you when you wear it.  As you look around the store you end up finding an elegant lingerie set.
      <br><br>
      You find Bailey nearby.  "Oh, I guess I don't need to ask you if you like what I was planning on buying," she says seeing you both holding
      nearly the same item.  The only difference is yours is in white, and hers is in black.
      <br><br>
      She tries it on and it looks beautiful on her.  You only hope you look as beautiful in yours when Andrew sees it.
    <<else>>
      You start off looking for a nice matching bra and panty set while she explores the rest of the store.  But as you look around, your
      mind wanders, and you are soon imagining Andrew undressing you.  You quickly tell yourself that you are imagining it was your wedding day,
      but you know you were imagining it happening tonight.
      <br><br>
      When you see a beautiful elegant lingerie set that you'd want to be what Andrew saw you wearing your first time together, you also
      find Bailey nearby.  "Oh, I guess I don't need to ask you if you like what I was planning on buying," she says seeing you both holding
      nearly the same item.  The only difference is yours is in white, and hers is in black.
      <br><br>
      She tries it on and it looks beautiful on her.  You only hope you look as beautiful in yours when Andrew sees it someday.

    "It's ok," you tell her.  "I've seen underwear before."  You look for a nice matching bra and panty set while she explores the rest of the store.
    You are fairly confident in your size now, so you decide not to try it on.  So once you have your purchase ready you look to go find her.
    <br><br>
    When you do find her, she wants to try something on so she can get your opinion on it.  When you see what she is wearing you tell her it looks lovely,
    and she looks beautiful in it.  "I might want to wear something like that on my wedding day.  But in white, of course," you tell her.  But then you
    realize she isn't going to be waiting until then, and is more likely going to be showing it off again really soon to one of the guys she'd met
    early today.
  <<else>>
    <<set setup.addInventory('underwear', 'sexy underwear')>>
    You love the look of wonder as she sees all the possibilities and choices she has now.  You let her explore while you look around for something
    sexy for yourself.
    <<if $PlayerChastityBelt>>
      You think you can even wear it over you belt, but you aren't going to try it on here.
    <</if>>
    When you've picked out something you like, you start looking for Bailey.
    <br><br>
    When you do find her, she wants to try something on so she can get your opinion on it.  She's picked out a lovely black lingerie set.  When she tries
    it on, she looks absolutely stunning in it.  "One of those guys we met earlier is going to be a very happy man I think.", you say, getting a big smile
    and a laugh from her.
  <</if>>
  You see that she couldn't decide on just the one item though, as her basket as quite a few other items in it as well.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once all of your and her shopping is done, you take her back home.  "I'll talk you again when we meet up [[later in the week|Part15Week]]," she says.  "But
  right now I need to go change, and then make a few phone calls."

<<nobr>>
  <<if !$CampusMinistry>>
    "Have fun!", you tell her.  "And be sure to give me all the details when I see you."
