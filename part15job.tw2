  You coworkers all agree that she was ridiculous.  Some even say they'd had similar problems with her in the past.  After venting a

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You put on a happy face once you are back in front of customers.  Thankfully the remainder of your shift is uneventful, but you are

  had earlier. "Really, I don't know what that bitch's problem was."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You flinch a bit when you feel a shock from the belt hit. You wonder what it's for?
  <<if $DailyBJMinimum>>
    You know it isn't your minimum blow job target.  You definitely exceeded it yesterday.
    <<if setup.areDating('Andrew')>>
      You smile, hoping Andrew's balls don't still ache today.

  You figure they must be testing something with the belt again.  Wonderful.

<<nobr>>
  "I made her latte just the way she asked.  It's not my fault she misordered," you continue.  "And I was going to remake
  the fucking thing..."  Another, slightly stronger shock hits and you can't help but cry out, "Fuck!"  Then a much stronger
  shock hits.  It dawns on you what is happening, so you instinctively slap your hand over your mouth as you double over in pain.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your coworkers can see you are in pain, though none of them have a clue as to why.  "I'm ok," you tell them quickly,

<<nobr>>
  You quickly head to the restroom.  Once you are safely in a stall you pull out your phone.  "Profanity Filter Violation," the
  notifications say.  "Are you fucking kidding me?"  You flinch, but then realize you only thought the words that time and didn't
  say them.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You briefly check to see if there's a way to turn it off, and aren't surprised when you find none.  You don't have time to worry
  about it now.  You have to get back to work, and it's not like you curse in front of customers, so it doesn't matter for now.

    It has been a long day at work.
  <<else>>
    When you get home you're stressed from the new setting on your belt, and from watching your team lose.
  <</if>>
  You know an orgasm would help you take your mind off your stressful day, but you know better than
  to even bother requesting one right now.  You know the belt won't give you one today, not after deciding to punish you earlier in the day.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  So you just try to put it out of your mind.  You don't even want to look into the new 'feature' they've added to your belt right now.
  You know there's not going to be anything you can do about it anyway.  You are careful to avoid any cursing the rest of the night though.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The next morning as you are getting ready you feel your belt start to stimulate you.  As you feel it slowly bringing you closer and
  closer to an orgasm you are glad the belt has forgiven you.  You didn't even need to request this orgasm, it must have just known how
  much you needed one after yesterday.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But before you cum, the belt stops abruptly and you see a notification appear on your phone:
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Orgasms are a reward for good girls.  Bad girls get denied.</b><br>
      As a reminder of this, you will be receiving multiple daily teases and edges.<br>
      Orgasms will be allowed again once you learn to be a good girl and watch your language.
    </blockquote>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  "A hate this stupid belt!," you say in frustration.  Even in your frustration and anger, you were careful not to curse.  But
  you are shocked anyway.  Another notification appears on your belt explaining why.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Belt Complaint Detected</b><br>
      Only bad girls complain.  Good girls know and accept their place.<br>
      Denial period has been extended.
    </blockquote>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You keep the thoughts filling your mind now to yourself.  Once you finish getting ready you finally go check out the details on the
  new "Profanity Filter" they added to your belt.  You see that in addition to the words you expected to be there, there are a few others
  you hadn't thought of.  But then there's the vague things like "Requesting Belt Removal" and "Defiant Tone."  And, of course "Belt
  Complaints," which you had already discovered.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It doesn't say what words or phrases are forbidden by these.  You don't want to risk triggering it again though, so you decide you'll
  just have to be careful to not say anything that might set it off.  You'll try not to even think about those things and risk saying something
  out loud on accident.

<<nobr>>
  After a long busy rush, the coffee shop has finally died down and you have a minute to look at the app on your phone to check the status of
  your chastity belt.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You were so relieved earlier this week, after your belt finally decided you'd been good long enough to allow you orgasms again.  That first one after
  the punishment period felt so good, you smile remembering it.  But you were surprised the next day, when the belt sprang to life.  After thirty
  madening minutes you discovered it wasn't giving you an orgasm.  Instead it would let your pleasure build, but then reduce the stimulation and
  let it die down, only to start back up again afterwards.  Finally ending with keeping you right on the edge of an orgasm for an eternity, then
  stopping abruptly.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The notification that followed made it clear what was happening:
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Good work on your behavior improvement!  Orgasm requests are now permitted.</b><br>
    As a reward, and to remind you to maintain proper behavior, you will continue to receive one or more teasing sessions daily.<br>
    These will not occur during work hours at your place of employment, or during scheduled class times.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You, of course, immediately requested an orgasm. "Request denied - too soon since last orgasm." was the immediate response.  You feel a moment
  of desire to be free of the belt, but you quickly push the thought from your mind.  You are too afraid of saying something it thinks is a complaint,
  so you've tried to stop even thinking of anything like that.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Seeing that it's been over 48 hours now since your orgasm, you request again.  You are again met with a "Request denied - too soon since last orgasm."
  message. All you can do is accept the denial, and hope for a different answer [[tomorrow|Part15JobBaristaWeek7Chaste2]].
<</nobr>>

  <h1>Teased between classes</h1>
  <img src="Part15/Chastity6.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="650" align="left">
  You feel like you are horny all the time now.  You'd tried to request an orgasm the day after you received the notification that they were
  allowed again, and again the day after that, and several times a day after that, all the request were denied.  All of them saying it was too
  soon since your last orgasm.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You know you wouldn't be so horny all the time if your belt didn't tease you every day, sometimes several times a day.
  You never know when it's going to decide to start teasing you, except that it doesn't happen at work, or when you are in class.  You guess it
  wants you to keep doing your job and schoolwork.  Today it has decided to start up while you are walking across campus, during a break between
  classes.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once it starts you find a bench to sit down at and try to hide your obvious arousal from everyone around you.  Once the teasing stops, denying
  you the orgasm you need again, you stare at the "Request Orgasm" button again.  You quickly press it.  Of course, you get denied again, but
  this time the message is different:
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Request Denied - Excessive Orgasm Requests Detected.</b><br>
    Addictive behavior suspected.<br>
    Please stand by while your arousal history is analyzed.<br>
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  "What!" you say in shock.  You cringe expecting a shock.  But there is none, as the rest of your thoughts on the message weren't said out loud.
  Instead, you sit patiently and wait for the app to give you the belt's decision.  It still hasn't responded when it's time for class.  It's not
  until later in the afternoon, after your classes, that an answer comes back:
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Arousal History Analysis Complete - Results Inconclusive</b><br>
    Consistently high arousal level observed, but possibly correlated to belt's tease and denial activity.<br>
    All orgasms and teases disabled pending manual evaluation.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You blush as you imagine someone in the engineering department going over detailed charts of how horny you've been, how many times you've
  requested an orgasm, probably even how many times you've been so wet it's leaked through the belt and made you need to change panties.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You had been complaining, silently to yourself of course, about how frustrating the teases it kept giving you were.  But after two
  days without them, you are wishing for them to return.  It wasn't an orgasm, but it was something at least.  You need something...
  Anything.  But all you can do is wait. 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Finally, on the third day the belt you get a notification [[that a decision has been made|Part15JobBaristaWeek7Chaste3]].
<</nobr>>

::Part15JobBaristaWeek7Chaste3
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Addictive behavior confirmed</h1>
  <img src="Part15/Chastity7.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="650" align="left">

  <blockquote>

    request functionality is causing an addictive response in you.<br>

  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  "Wait, what does that mean?" you wonder but don't say out loud.  "I'm not addicted!" you think.  You want to appeal the decision, but
  you know it won't be any use.  They'd just see that as desperation, and be more conviced you're addicted -- to what? Orgasm?  Instead you
  try to figure out what these "protocols" it is referring to are.  You don't have to wonder long, because soon another notifications appears.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Wearer addiction protocols enabled</b><br>
    Orgasm capability reenabled, but wearer orgasm request functionality disabled.<br>
    Only reward-based or owner-provided orgasms will now be allowed.<br>
    Previously activated behavior reminders continuing at reduced frequency.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  Since your 'owner' is the engineering department, you don't expect they'll be any 'owner-provided' orgasms while that continues.  And they already
  told you, that even if you met someone, they won't add them as an owner until after the testing period is over.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are left wondering what the 'reward-based' orgasms are.  You know the belts the slutty girls are in gives them orgasms for
  giving out blowjobs, but you know your belt isn't going to do that.
  <<if setup.haveInventory('piercings', 'tongue sensor')>>
    You've already had a taste of how painful giving one of those would be.
  <<else>>
    They were very clear about how painful it would be for you if you even tried to give one of those.
  <</if>>
  Not that you would, of course.  You don't even notice your finger teasing your lips as you think about it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But you can't even see what it has for you instead, since the app has locked you out entirely for now.  You'll have to
  [[wait until tomorrow|Part15JobBaristaWeek7Chaste4]] to find out.

  <h1>Earning Points</h1>
  <img src="Part15/Chastity8.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="650" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  The next day, once the app lets you back in, you go in to see how to earn an orgasm.  You see it works on a points system to encourage
  'good behavior'.  It says it's based on the preferences you gave during registration.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  There are different 'training routines' you can sign up for.  You earn a set number of points every week for each of them.  And whenever
  you reach 100 points, you get an orgasm!  But if you sign up for one of the 'routines', it commits you to continuing with it, and starts
  punishing you with shocks and taking points away if you miss it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You start going down the list picking off the easy ones you know you can do:<br>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  - Religious services: "Sunday church attendance: 5 points/week, 5 point penalty per absence."<br>
  You've stopped going as regularly, but this one is easy so you sign up for it.  Faith and Mark will be happy to see you coming every week again.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  - Exercise: "30 minutes/day: 1 point/day at least twice a week.  (Maximum: 5 points/week.)"<br>
  <<if $BodyType == 'Fit'>>
    This one will be a breeze for you.
  <<elseif $BodyType == 'Plus'>>
    You hate exercising, but you know you probably should be doing it anyway.
  <<else>>
    Exercise isn't your favorite thing, but you know you should being doing it, so it's an easy five points.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  - Good student: "Penalty for missed clasess.  Bonus points awarded at end of term for good grades."
  This one was automatically checked, and it won't let you uncheck it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  - Personal grooming: "Shaving body hair a least twice a week.  1 point each time (Maximum: 3 points/week.)"<br>
  <<if $PlayerNoBodyHair>>
    This one is disabled for you, since they knew it's not an issue for you.
  <<else>>
    You do this most of the time anyway, so why not earn points for it.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  - [[Daily Affirmations|Part15JobBaristaWeek7Chaste5]]: "Reciting motivation phrases to encourage personal growth.
  (Up to 3 points/week, with bonus stimulation and/or orgasm)<br>
  Affirmations are based on sexuality and gender role preferences you previously provided."<br>
  This one seems really easy, and with the promise of bonus stimulation and maybe even orgasms, of course you check it!
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Most of the other ones look to require a lot more work and you aren't sure you want to do them, let alone commit to doing them or getting
  punished.  Things like learning a new language,
  <<if $BodyType == 'Plus'>>
    losing weight,
  <<elseif $BodyType == 'Fit'>>
    training to run a marathon,
  <<else>>
    training to run a 10K race,
  <</if>>
  and volunteering for
  <<if $SororityELP>>
    even more hours than you already do
  <<else>>
    hours
  <</if>>
  every week.  You'd hate to sign up, then try and fail and get punished for it, so you skip those.
<</nobr>>

::Part15JobBaristaWeek7Chaste5
<<nobr>>
  <h1>Daily Affirmations</h1>
  The next morning, after getting your daily exercise requirement <<if !$PlayerNoBodyHair>>and personal grooming<</if>>
  done, you start with your first day of 'daily affirmations'.  You start up the app and pull up that option.  It presents you with a
  list of instructions.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Daily Affirmation - Instructions</b><br>
    Keep your phone camera pointed at your face at all times.<br>
    Speak clearly and be sincere.<br>
    If signs of insincerity are detected, penalties may apply.<br>
    Sessions are permanently archived for later evaluation.<br>
    Select sessions may be made available for review by your current or future partners.
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  Your only option is to hit "Agree" and continue.  Then it says to repeat each phrase as it appears.  That instruction fades and is replaced
  with an image of your face from the camera.  A moment later the phrase.  "<b><i>I am committed to staying chaste until I am married</i></b>,"
  appears.  You don't feel as sure about that as you did $SchoolWeek weeks ago.  But you repeat the phrase as earnestly as you can.  It then
  has you repeat it several more times before going on to the next phrase.  You smile as you you feel gentle vibrations from the belt start
  rewarding you for your first affirmation.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "<b><i>Sexual desire is natural and a wonderful part of a healthy marriage</i></b>," you repeat this one several times without any problems.
  The vibrations continue to stimulate you and even increase a bit.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You stare at the screen when "<b><i>But, I am not capable of controlling my sexual urges</i></b>," appears on the screen.  You hesitate to say
  it, especially knowing your future boyfriend, and eventual husband, might see this.  After a few moments the pleasant sensations from the belt
  stop and you see a countdown appear on the screen:  "5... 4..."
<</nobr>>
<img src="Part15/Chastity9.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="450" align="left">
<<nobr>>
  You are afraid of what will happen if it gets to zero, so you reluctantly repeat the phrase.  After it warns you about being sincere, you
  repeat the phrase again.  It accepts your response that time, and has you repeat it several more times.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "<b><i>I need to be locked in my chastity belt to protect me from my urges</i></b>," it says.  Thinking of someone else looking at
  this makes you hesitant to say the words, but you say them anyway.  As the words come out of your mouth, deep down you know that they
  are true.  The belt resumes its stimulation as it continues on to the next phrase.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Several more phrases come up and you repeat each one: First, "<b><i>I can't be trusted to decide when I orgasm</i></b>."
  Your voice trembles a bit as you say, "<b><i>My orgasms should be a rare and precious gift</i></b>."
  You bite your lower lip as you say, "<b><i>I am eager to learn how to give pleasure to my future husband with my belt still on</i></b>,"
  while you imagine the most obvious way to do that.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Which each phrase, when you say it sincerly and without hestiation the vibrations increase.  You are warned once to make sure your face is
  visible when you cover your mouth to hide a moan.  But thankfully, you are not punished for that.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The screen for the final affirmation is different.  This one tells you to speak in your own words and tells you to describe why you need to
  be in a chastity belt.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You start by just paraphrasing what you said earlier, and as you continue talking you feel the belts vibrations increase.  You are eager for
  it to continue so you start adding more.  You talk about how you want your wedding night to be special, and about how you want your future
  husband to be the only man you are ever with.  But as you continue the vibrations increase and you become distracted.  When you repeat
  something you've already said, you see a message that it was not accepted, and are warned that another repeat will end the session.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Desperate for the stimulation to continue, you start saying anything you think the program wants to hear.  You ramble on about what a horny
  slut you are, about what you would do if you were unlocked, and how you need to be locked to protect yourself.  But eventually the pleasure
  distracts you too much and you repeat yourself again, and the stimulation abruptly stops.
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>

    Good Job! 1 point awarded<br>
    Total points earned: <<if $PlayerNoBodyHair>>2<<else>>3<</if>> points<br>
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Later that day, when you are counting out your points, you realize that even if you earn all
  <<if $PlayerNoBodyHair>>
    <<set $BeltPointsPerWeek to 13>>
    13 points per week, it'll still be 7 or 8 
  <<else>>

    16 points per week, it'll still be 6 or 7
  <</if>>
  weeks until your next orgasm.  But there's nothing you can do about that right now.  You decide to earn the 1 bonus point it has
  offered you by spending 30 minutes rewatching the recording it made of your affirmations.  You can only hope that it will
  offer more bonus points sometime later.

  <<set $tempBeltPoints to ($BeltPointsPerWeek * 4 - 5)>>
  <<set $tempBeltPointsWish to ($tempBeltPoints + 25)>>
  Between the weekly points you've been earning and the bonus points you've earned you should have had $tempBeltPointsWish points by now.
  You could have been having an orgasm
  <<if $tempBeltPointsWish + $BeltPointsPerWeek >= 100>>
    next week!
  <<else>>
    in a couple weeks!
  <</if>>
  But you've also lost points along the way: for being late for class once, for cursing, for complaining about your belt, and more.
  So instead you only have $tempBeltPoints points, and an orgasm is still weeks away!
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You need that orgasm so much right now, so your heart races when you see the notification on your phone:
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Congratulations! 100 additional points have been awarded.</b><br>
    Based on your profile, you've been selected for an optional training program.<br>
    Once the easy signup requirements are completed you will recieve your orgasm!<br>
    Please check your email for details on how to accept or decline this offer.<br>
    Note: There is no penalty for declining this offer. (*)
  </blockquote>
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You hurry to your email to see the details.  It says that you've been signed up because your profile indicated that you were a heterosexual
  virgin, but have a strong desire to have a rewarding sex life with your husband someday.  "I suppose that's pretty accurate," you think to
  yourself.  Reading it makes you realize you've been fantasizing a lot about your wedding night lately.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  They are promising to help "Teach you to be the best wife you can be" and that their "[[Wife training program|Part15JobBaristaWeek11Chaste2]]"
  program is "consistent with your desire to remain chaste."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You see there are only two requirements to earn your orgasm. You have to stop by the engineering department and pick up your "training kit".
  Then go home and complete an "easy initial training session". You will orgasm at then completion of your session!
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You already know your points reset after an orgasm, so the extra the extra $tempBeltPoints you have now will be lost.  But this new program
  says it can award you "up to 40 points/week, plus occasional bonus points"!  With that and your regular points, you could be having an orgasm
  every other week!
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You see the footnote at the end, and see what that asterisk meant on the notification.  It looks like if you decline you won't be punished,
  but your points will be reset to zero, whether you get the orgasm from signing up or not.  You'd already decided you couldn't pass up the offer.
  You didn't need any more convincing.

  When you get to the engineering department and pick up your "wife training kit", you are a bit shocked when you see the contents.
  "You don't want to disappoint your future husband on your wedding night do you?" the person giving you the kit asks.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "No. Of course not.  I guess I just thought that he..." you don't finish the sentence.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "You expected him to have experience even if you didn't?  Or that you assumed he would enjoy himself while you just laid there?"
  Actually, you realize you'd assumed both of those.  But you sense this technician has had this same conversation several times today
  and is a bit annoyed.  You just nod and apologize and take the kit.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  When you get home you open the belt's app again.  It knows you've picked up the kit and gives you the option to start your first
  training session.  You are eager for the orgasm it promised, you start it immediately.  It tells you to get out the practice dildo and
  how to get it ready.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are alone in the room, but you still feel embarrassed as you begin the session.  Especially since you are required to have your
  phone pointing at you, so the system can observe and record your whole session.  But the gentle stimulation the belt starts
  giving you soon make you forget about the embarrassment and eager to continue.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You still don't know what you are doing and are constantly getting instructions told to you by your phone as you go.  You feel like you
  are getting beter though, and the stimulation from your belt has increased, and you feel yourself getting closer to an orgasm.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  But then one of the sensors in the dildo notices when you accidently let your teeth hit the dildo.  The stimulation abruptly stops
  as your phone tells you what you did wrong.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It then tells you to take a 15 minute rest and hydration break before you [[begin again|Part15JobBaristaWeek11Chaste3]].

    <video src="Part15/Chastity12.mp4" autoplay loop muted height="450"></video>
  </div>
  You are on your third try, you've been practicing on your dildo for well over an hour now.  But you think you've gotten much better.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  There's very few instructions coming from your phone now.  It's mostly just the recorded moans of some guy that it is giving you
  now to encourage you.  The app has also switched to a deeper 'male' voice to give the occasional compliment on how well you are doing.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  The 'moans' have increased and the apps regular voice returns to tell you, "Don't stop.  Your husband is about to cum.  Make
  sure you swallow every drop for him."
  <<if setup.haveInventory('piercings', 'tongue sensor')>>
    You wonder if you'll get punished tomorrow for swallowing it, but you don't care.  You'll do whatever it tells you to do
    for the orgasm it's promised.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You hear another moan, the kind you've heard guys make in porn when they cum.  Then you feel your practice dildo shoot the fluid
  you'd loaded it with earlier into your mouth.
  <<if setup.haveInventory('piercings', 'tongue sensor')>>
    It tastes and feels so much like before that you wonder if the 'simulation cum' was real cum, maybe from one the engineering
    technicians.
  <<else>>
    It tastes and feels... strange.
  <</if>>
  But with the belt stimulating you much more now, you eagerly swallow it down, making sure to get every ounce of it 
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Good girl," the app tells you.  "You've earned a reward."  The stimulation from your belt increases even more. Soon you are crying
  out as it pushes you over the edge.  It keeps going as weeks of denied pleasure finally flow through you.  Just when it starts to become
  too much, the belt begins to die down.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are sitting there, with your head resting on your desk basking in the afterglow when you hear $Roommate say, "Well, it looks
  like that belt of yours lets you have some fun after all."  Mortified and wondering how much she saw, you quickly pack your dildo
  back into the 'kit'.
  <<if $Roommate == "Kiera">>
    Though, if you can work up the nerve, you might ask her later for some advice.  You know she's sucked her share of guys off, and
    you want to do a good job for your next lesson.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your throat is a bit sore the next day, but still you are eager to go again and start earning the points towards your next orgasm.
  But the app says it is giving your mouth the day off to rest because of how long your session lasted.  It says that instead you will
  be focusing on your 'anal cleaning routine'.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You are nervous as you pull out that part of the kit and realize where the nozzle is going to be going in a few minutes.  But you
  are eager to do whatever it takes to earn your points.  Oh... and to learn to be a good wife for your future husband, you think afterwards.

  Early on he did tell you what he wanted.  But what he wanted is for you to be in control.  One session you teased his cock while he

  he wasn't allowed to touch himself, he'd have to wait to orgasm until his next visit.  Maybe.  He left with blue balls but still gave
  you a massive tip.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You could tell at his next visit that he'd obeys.  He was desperately to cum.  You actually let him fuck you, and even cum inside you.
  Then you made him eat you out until all his cum was gone, and you'd orgasmed several times.

  You try thinking of ways to attack the belt you are wearing.  You know better than to try any physical attacks, so you dismiss that.  You think you can
  probably trick the oral detection routines to think you are giving a blowjob when you are not.  If you do that then... You realize that does nothing for you.
  It's not going to give you an orgasm, or unlock you.
  <<if $dating.length>>
    And it's not like $dating[0] isn't eager to let you test whenever you like on them.
  <<else>>
    And it's not like finding a cock to suck on campus is that difficult anyway.
  <</if>>
  You keep thinking.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You pull up the app and look around, most of the settings are disabled... Then you have an idea.  You make sure your phone is on the wifi, and fire up a
  packet sniffer.  Then you restart the app and record the traffic to and from your phone.  You get excited as soon as you see the results.  All the data
  back in forth is right there, in plain text.  You can see the values for all the settings comming back, even though the app wouldn't show you most of them.
  Though the settings in your case a boring, nearly everything is disabled.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Your eyes stop at:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>accessLevel: 'WEARER'</code><br>
  in the messages from the server to the app.  You have an idea, but you can't believe it'd be this easy.  There's a mountain of source code, but you search
  it and find where that's being set, and where's it's being checked.  You can't believe it,  you're pretty sure this will work.  You write a small
  program that just intercepts the data from the server and changes the value to<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>accessLevel: 'OWNER'</code><br>
  Then you restart the app to see what happens.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It worked! It comes back with the owner version of the status screen.  It shows your last orgasm: "Never", at least as far as the belt is concerned. it
  has your current arousal level, all the settings you'd seen from the network traffic.  But most importantly, all the controls to change the settings are no
  longer disabled!  Still, even though the app was fooled, the server might be smart enough to ignore the request, because it still knows you're the wearer.
  The code is a mess, you'd spend hours trying to figure it from looking at that, and still probably not be sure.  So you decide to just test it.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You look around through the settings looking for settings to change.  "Global Orgasm Block" was set to on, which tells it not to let you orgasm, regardless
  of any other setting.  That's the first thing you are going to turn off.  You hit the button and wait.  A moment later the app shows that it's been disbled.
  You check the network traffic and it looks good too!  You notice your arousal ticking up on the status page.  The belt knows you are thinking you might
  be able to cum tonight.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You go to the oral settings page, and you see it's activate, but orgasms are disabled.  You decide to change that, setting it to "Every time" instead.
  You see that change was accepted also.  You also see your arousal level rising even faster.  The belt detects how much you are thinking about pausing your
  testing for now so you can [[go verify your new setting|Part15JobEngineerLockOrgasm]] with
  <<if setup.haveGirlfriend()>>
    $dating[0].  You are aleady wet thinking about the belt giving you an orgasm with your head burried between her legs.

    It builds as before, and then holds as you continue to work his cock.  You get more and more frantic as you suck his cock, hungry for your own orgasm.

    After so many months without an orgasm, it feels so amazing.  You want to go again right away, but you know $dating[0] needs a few minutes.  You lie

    As soon as he's ready, you go again, and the belt gives you an orgasm again just as he cums for you.  You want to go again, and again, but he says

    enough for tonight, or if you want to go find another cock.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  As you are laying there on the bed, still in the afterglow of your orgasm you glance of at your phone.  You see a text from your boss.  "Congratulations
  on the orgasm!" it says.  A year ago you would have been embarrassed at him knowing you just came, multiple times in fact.  But he's seen you cum many
  times on testing videos by now, so him getting a notification from your belt doesn't surprise or concern you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "I see you changed the settings from the app somehow.  Great job!  We can go over the details tomorrow.  Have fun with your new settings until then," he
  has after that.  You check the app and it now says "Sorry, this app is down for routine maintenance."  He must have turned it off until the bug is fixed.
  I guess that's one of the benefits of testing pre-release.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Knowing tonight might be your only chance for a while, you
  <<if setup.haveGirlfriend()>>
    consider seeing if $dating[0] is up for another round.  But you are still exhausted from before and decide thats enough for now.  You talk to $dating[0]
    and she says that since tonight might be it for a while, if you wake up horny in the middle of the night, feel free to wake her up with your tongue.  You
    do just that several times during the night.
  <<elseif $dating.length>>
    $dating[0] doesn't want another blowjob right now, but he says to feel free to wake him up tonight with one if you wake up horny.  "Actually, not just tonight,
    feel free to do that anything," he adds with a smile.  You do just that several times during the night.
  <<else>>
    decide to go out and find another guy.  After he's ready to stop, you go out to another one.  After he's been emptied twice, you notice the time.  It's going
    to be hard to find another guy without knocking on doors and waking someone up.  And you need some sleep too.  So you decide that will have to be enough.
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You wake up tired the next morning, but at least not as desperately horny as you have been for so long.  You quickly dress and
  [[head to the Engineering department|Part15JobEngineerLock2]].

  <img src="Part15/Engineer11.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="600" align="left">
<</nobr>>
<<nobr>>
  You keep looking through the options, then you see the "Unlock" hidden two or three pages in from the Owner menu.  Either their design needs some
  usability work, or this isn't an option they are expecting Owners to be using that often.  But obviously, it's the option you want, so you hit "Unlock."
  "Are you sure?" it asks.  "Yes I'm sure!", you say as you hit the button.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Enter unlock code." it says asking for a six digit number.  You don't know what to type, and there's no cancel button.  You think about just killing the
  app, but you don't know what that will do, so you just guess.  They didn't have much security on the network, so maybe it's just as bad here. "000000",
  instantly comes back with "incorrect unlock code."  You try "123456" and "654321" and they don't work either.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Then you think about the mostly guys you work with and how they think.  And then you type "696969."  This time it doesn't come back immediately with an
  incorrect message, it seems to be processing it.  You wait in anticipation to hear a click from your belt.  You are already getting wet imagining
  getting bent over your desk and feeling
  <<if setup.haveGirlfriend()>>
    $dating[0]'s strap-on
  <<elseif $dating.length>>
    $dating[0]'s cock 
  <<else>>
    some guy's cock
  <</if>>
  slide into you.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Then the screen turns red and the message "Unauthorized access attempted - Account Locked."  A second later you feel pain shoot though your clit as
  the belt gives you some sort of a shock.  You close the app and reopen it.  It immediately gives you a prompt to enter a pass code to unlock the
  account. You are afraid to enter anything by guessing anymore and close the app.  You turn off your hack so it won't think you are the owner anymore,
  but the wearer.  When you do, there's a message that says.  "Your unauthorized access was detected.  Punishment shocks will continue until deactivated
  by Owner."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You close the app and try to think.  After a few minutes you feel the pain hit again. There's nothing you can do to get away from it, even though
  you try.  A couple minutes later you get a text message from your boss.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Oops, looks like someone tried to hack something. :-)", his text says.  A few moments later he says, "I would turn off the shocks you are probably
  receiving right now, but the unlock codes are all random, and I have them locked away in my office.  I'll take care of it first thing in the morning.
  Sorry, you're going to have an unpleasant night.  Let me know tomorrow what happened."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You decide to at least enjoy the setting you made earlier.  You
  <<if setup.haveGirlfriend()>>
    <<set setup.addSex({sex:"female", name:$dating[0]})>>
    ask $dating[0] if you can eat her out.  Of course she says yes.
  <<elseif $dating.length>>
    <<set setup.addSex({sex:"male", name:$dating[0]})>>
    ask $dating[0] if you can suck his cock.  Of course he says yes.
  <<else>>
    <<set setup.addSex({sex:"male"})>>
    go out to find some guy's cock to suck.  It doesn't take long to find a volunteer.
  <</if>>
  You soon discover that not only is the orgasm setting not working, but it isn't even giving you the teasing vibrations it was before.  It must
  have disabled anything it thought you might enjoy.  You don't stop though, that would be rude.  It's not
  <<if $dating.length>>
    $dating[0]'s
  <<else>>
    this guy's
  <</if>>
  fault.  One nice thing you discover though is that it isn't shocking you while you are taking care of
  <<if setup.haveGirlfriend()>>her<<else>>him<</if>>.  So you take your time, making as slow and sensual as you can and enjoying not being shocked
  for a while.  But eventually it ends, and the shocks resume.

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  With shocks waking you up at random times throughout the night, you wake up exhausted.  The shocks are still hitting you as you start on your way to
  [[the Engineering department|Part15JobEngineerLock2]].  Hopefully you boss gets in soon and turns them off!

    Of course, you're tempted to not tell them how to fix the hack so you can enjoy your new setting.  But that wouldn't work.  Your boss could just
    disable your belt's orgasms from some admin interface, and then they'd eventually figure out the bug anyway.  Then end result would be the same,
    except you wouldn't get your bonus, so you might as well tell how you did it.
    <br><br>
    "You look exhausted," your boss says when you sit down in his office.  Then he laughs.  "Well, I guess you didn't get much sleep last night, did you?"

    "You look exhausted," your boss says when you sit down in his office.  Then he laughs.  "Well, I guess you didn't get much sleep last night, did you?"
    After a moment he says, "As I'm sure you've felt, or haven't felt, I turned off the punishment shocks this morning when I came in to the office.  But
    the fact that you got far enough to even trigger the account down shows you found a flaw.  So, what did you find?"
  <</if>>
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You explain how the communications between the app and the server aren't encrpyted and how the app responded as if you were the owner just by changing
  one value.  And the server accepted the commands the app sent back even though it knew you were the wearer not the owner.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  "Those are some pretty glaring flaws, I'm glad you found them now," he tells you. "And thankfully it sounds like it won't require any major work.  A few
  lines of code on the server to use it's own authorization information instead of whatever the app says.  And of course, encrypting everything.  I'm
  guessing a few weeks and then you can get back to testing."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  <<if $EngineerLockPacketOrgasm>>
    "I'll send the paperwork in for your bonus payment, good work," he says.  "Oh, and your belt's settings.
    We'll leave them like they are now until the bugs are fixed and you can test again.  Have fun the next week or two!"  You know you
    <<if $dating.length>>and $dating[0]<</if>> will.
  <<else>>
    "As you probably discovered, when you triggered the account lockdown, it automatically re-activated the Global Orgasm Block," he says.  "And you weren't
    able to orgasm before then, and obviously weren't able to unlock the belt.  So, I'm sorry, but I can't authorized a bonus payment.  But you did a great
    job, and I do still want to reward you."
    <br><br>
    "So I'm activating random teases and edges for you," he says.  "Your classes shouldn't be that challenging yet this early in the semester, so hopefully
    it won't be too much of a distraction.  I'll turn it off whenever you can go back to testing again.  Oh, and I turned the non-orgasm oral encouragement
    back on, from the log here it seems like you really enjoyed that."

<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He also has you give a talk to your fellow student engineers about encryption and not trusting client-side data.  Though many of the male engineers
  seem to not be paying much attention.  Not that you mind, the more mistakes they make, the more bugs you'll be able to find.

<<nobr>>
  You check your previous method, and confirm that they have fixed it, all the data to and from the belt is completely unreadable now.  You don't know how
  strong the enryption they are using is, but its definitely beyond your abilities to decipher.  You'll have to find someing else.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You suspect they don't have any encryption, and maybe not even security checks on the belts disagnostic interface. Unfortunately, the small port you need
  to access it is under a waterproof cover on the inner side of the belt.  And it's completely inaccessibile while you are wearing it.  That doesn't help you at
  all.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Though you make a note to mention the possibility of a belt failure and some poor girl being stuck because the can't access it.  But you suspect that
  since they aren't the ones at risk of having that happen to them, they are going to think it's an acceptable risk for the added security.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  In a moment of technical and sexual frustration you have the urge to just violently attack the belt, but it quickly passes.  You know you are very likely
  to injure yourself, and very unlikely to have effect at all on the belt, except possibly to trigger a punishment.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You also toss out the idea of hacking the administrative website directly.  It's beyond the scope of what you are supposed to test, and couldn't earn you
  any bonus.  Not any financial bonus anyway.  Besides, they already have someone else working on testing it.  He's one of the brighter guys on the team,
  so he's probably doing a good job, though you doubt he's as motivated as you are right now.
<</nobr>>

  After looking through the documentation again you come across a section on adding accessory devices and resolving owner conflicts,

    <br><br>
    Your phone gives you a "Confirm new owner" prompt.  You neverously press "Confirm."  A moment later you are delighted when your phone says,

    Your voice is trembling when you direct $tempLockAssist to the unlock option.  He

    clicks unlock.  It prompts him for the passcode he'd setup earlier.  You wait nervously as it says "Waiting..."
    <br><br>
    After what seems like an eternity a message appears: "Unlock denied.  All owners must approve unlock requests."  It then says that your other owner,
    your boss, rejected the unlock request.

<<nobr>>
  "Just a moment.  I want to see what other options there are here.", he says.  The realization hits you that, other than being
  able to unlock you, he has complete control over your belt.  He could have it do anything he wants, or use it to make you do
  whatever he wants.  And there's nothing you can do about it.

    "Oh... Ok," you say nervously.  "But please be careful.  Some of the options can be painful.  And not in a fun way."
    You are hoping his curiosity will be short lived and he'll quickly get back to your orgasm.  You shift nervously at first
    eager for your orgasm.

    But his exploration of the app continues.  You mind races with ideas of what he might use the app to make you do.  You

  You've started to feel the belt's, and the bra's, stimulations start.  They are soft at first, so you can still focus on what

  with each other  You are so hot when you are horny like this.  I'm tempted to never let you cum, and keep you this horny
  constantly."  He smiles when he sees the look on your face.  "I said I was tempted,

  She can't always be with you though.  In addition to the daily minimum requirement, in another one of your attempts where you were too horny and

  With nothing else planned today, you are planning to spend most of the day testing your belt again.  With a whole day to focus on it, maybe you'll

  your belt stop.

  Now your mind is filled with thoughts of where to find another cock to suck, so you can get your belt to reward you with more of those wonderful

    You're not a famous athlete, so none of the athletic brands are interested in keeping you on long-term.  You have an opportunity

    Your agent has mostly been finding lingerie jobs for you.  You remind him that you appreciate that work, but you are open to other

  After your discussion, your agent has lined up a swimsuit shoot for you.
  <<if $BodyType == "Fit">>
    Sports magazines have an annual swimsuit issue, right, so it's still just as respectable of a modeling job as any you figure.
  <<else>>
    You figure it's nothing after all the lingerie shoots you've done.  You realize you'll be showing more skin in a bikini than in most of

  Once your shoot begins you realize there's no changing room, or even a screen to stand behind.  The shoot is on a beach, and there's

  When Joseph takes you back to his private studio he goes to a rack of clothes.  He searches until he finds one he likes, and and then brings
  it back to you.  He's watched you undress dozens of times today, but you do your best to make this time more enticing than the quick
  changes before.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  This is nothing like what you've been modeling before.  The top frames and pushes up your breasts, but leaves them completely uncovered.
  And the buckles on the collar make you feel like his horny slave girl.  Of course the soft cuffs he has you put on your wrists only reinforce
  that.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He can see your unease when he pulls out a camera, a small video camera this time.  "Don't worry, this is just for me.  I'll delete it before
  you leave if you want."  You are too turned on to object, and eagerly obey as he hands you a bowl of ice cubes and has you tease your exposed
  breasts with one.  When your nipples are fully erect he hands you nipple clamps and orders you to wear them.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  He hasn't even touched you, merely instructed you on how to touch yourself.  But you can barely control yourself.  You are ready
  to rip off the shiny panties he's had you wear and beg him to fuck you.  But he tells you to stop before you can get them off.
<</nobr>>

  "[[We're not done yet|Part15JobModel4]]," he says as he continues to hands you a box with more toys.

  First he has you put the ball gag in your mouth.  Once you are silenced he hands you the candle he'd lit earlier.
  You are nervous when he tells you to pour the hot wax it's collected on yourself.  "Don't worry," he tells you.
  "It's not a regular candle.  It's hot, but not enought to burn you."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It takes you a minute to work up the courage to do it, but you tip the candle over dripping the hot wax down onto you
  breasts.  You cry out into your gag when you do.  The wax quickly hardens on your skin.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You'd be begging for his cock if you weren't still gagged, but he makes you wait a bit longer still.  He hands you the camera
  and has it play back what he's recorded for you as he goes to grab something else from the rack.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  You'd be playing with your clit as you watch, if he handn't ordered you not to.  But besides how much it is turning you on, you
  notice something else.  He's been very careful to not show your face, not enough of to recognize you anyway.
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  Once he returns, he tells you to take off the gag and the rest and change into the new outfit.  You obey and begin to change.  As you
  are changing, he asks you what you thought of the video.  You tell him you loved it.  "So you don't still want me to delete it?"
  You tell him not to delete it, and in fact you to send you a copy.  "Do you mind if I share it, as long as I don't let anyone know
  who the mystery woman is."
<</nobr>>

<<nobr>>
  It turns you on thinking about others seeing you submit to him, and get as turned on as you just did rewatching it.
  "Share it with whomever you like," you tell him.  "Just don't make me wait any longer for this," you say as you begin
  to [[unbuckle his pants|Part15JobModel5]].

  He does reach up to pull your breasts free so he can watch them as you bounce up and down on his cock.

  When you cum, you collapse down onto him.  He rolls you over onto your back with his cock still inside and continues fucking where

  Hours later when you leave, he tells you can keep the outfits and toys.  You get the sense there are plenty more where these came from
