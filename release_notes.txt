1.11.00 : Added part 11, added in coordinates for all passages to support twine

1.10.00 : Added part 10, revamped the side-effect selection system, reducing some video sizes to reduce zip size (more to do here),
          various fixes and edge cases addressed

1.09.54 and prior : Thanks to JonesI @ tfgamessite for converting my initial captions into a Twine-based game, and for all the updates after that.
note: Part 4 of the CYOA is skipped as it was female-to-male transformation content that didn't fit as part of this story
